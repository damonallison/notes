# Leadership

## Jamie : DevOps

### On teams

* Product teams + service teams. Not project teams - no incentive to do things right.

* How much governance should we impose on teams? If you prove your track record
  is good, you get less restrictions. (Damon: Trust Driven Development)


### On Architecture

* Nobody buys architecture. Nobody buys your process. They buy outcomes. Focus on the outcomes for your customer.

* Leadership should set the overall objectives, goals, let the teams decide how to best achieve.

* EA needs to be small. EA is successful if you don't have enterprise refactoring later.

### On culture

* Change will not happen overnight. Keep pushing on a few things, but don't
  overshoot organizational dissonance. Organizational dissonance is the maximum
  amount of change a company can adopt. If you introduce too much change, the
  company will revolt.

* Foster a community org chart like you foster an HR org chart. Have events for
  both community and corporate events alike. All hands meetings for corporate,
  dev days for community. Different leaders. The CIO is on top of the org chart,
  on the bottom of the community org chart.

* Have guilds for cross functional teams. GraphQL.

### On Process

* You get what you measure. Measure for outcomes.
* Teams that ship more win more.
