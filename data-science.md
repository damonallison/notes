# Data Science Research

## Why

Why study data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?

* AI is an obvious evolution within corporate engineering.
* Web, mobile, cloud, and intelligence.
* The problems are challenging and difficult. They are academic and foundational computer science problems.
* Work with smart people.

## Goals

* Work on algorithmically challenging, interesting projects with the latest computer science tooling.
* Respectable, recognizable certification or degree.
* All coursework transferable to a higher degree.
* Grow my personal network with data science engineers.

## Strategy

* Meet people. Use this research to rekindle existing relationships and grow new relationships.
* Use C.H. Robinson to grow. There is a lot of opportunity to work with data science teams / projects within C.H.
* Coursework. Work with an online program with transferable credits to a more advanced degree (i.e., masters degree)

## Approach

* Start small, free, in data science (hadoop, spark, statistics). Learn the tooling and concepts.
* Work into the industry.
* Advance into machine learning.
