# Who Moved My Cheese #

â€‹Like it or not, the world is speeding up. Technology is making massive advances in the world. The rate of change is only going to accelerate. Change gives you the ultimate option : adapt or die. Change is hard. Humans are creatures of habit. We like stability. When we find something we love - a job, a person, anything - we want to keep it.

Who Moved My Cheese describes how people deal with change and gives practical tips for recognizing and dealing with change.

"Cheese" is a metaphor which represents what we love about life. For some, it's a job. Others, it's money, other people, our house, etc. The book describes 4 characters : 2 mice - Sniff and Scurry, and two little people - Hem and Haw. They live in a maze and need to find cheese to stay alive. The mice are simple and work on instincts. The people are complex, and analytical. Sniff can sense change. Scurry reacts to change quick. Hem denies change and is afraid. Haw learns to adapt over time.

All 4 characters find the cheese. Hem and Haw move their homes next to the cheese. They are confident and happy - convinced they will always have cheese and live good lives. One day, the cheese disappears! Sniff and Scurry, who recognized the cheese had been shrinking, took off immediately to find new cheese. Hem and Haw complained, denied, and protested about their cheese being gone. They demanded that the cheese will be replaced and they started to wait for the cheese to return. Sniff and Scurry found new cheese. Hem and Haw waited. After they were both starving, Haw decided to timidly venture out. Over time, he gained wisdom and confidence. He started writing his newfound wisdom on the maze walls in hopes his friend Hem would see them if he ever ventured out for new cheese.

The advice he leaves on the walls applies to all of us. His wisdom make you reflect on how you deal with change in life. The sayings can be broadly divided into categories:

* Self-reflective. How do you deal with change? How should you deal with change?
* Motivational. What would you do if you weren't afraid? What are you afraid of? Be confident.
* Situational. Look around at your situation. Is your situation changing? Are you keeping up in the world? Are you staying competitive?

Haw's wisdom:

* "The more important cheese is to you the more you want to hold on to it."
* "If you do not change, you'll become extinct."
* "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
* "Smell the cheese often so you know when it's getting old."
* "When you stop being afraid you feel good."
* "The quicker you let go of the old cheese the quicker you'll find new cheese."
* "Old beliefs do not lead you to new cheese."
* "Noticing small changes early help you adapt to big changes that are too come."

The book was filled with general principles on dealing with fear, change, confidence, and self-awareness. Some of the main points I took home are:

* Confidence is critical. Trying new things, overcoming fear gives you confidence.
* What you are afraid of is never as bad as what you imagine.
* When you change what you believe you change what you do.
* Sniff and scurry kept life simple. When the situation changes they move on.
* Keep things simple and move quickly.
* Some fear is good, healthy. But don't let fear paralyze you.
* The fastest way to change is to laugh at yourself and move on.
* Reflect on your mistakes and use them to plan your future.
* You are your own biggest inhibitor to change.
* There is always new cheese out there.
* Explore around. Don't get too comfortable. Be aware of your choices.
* Be aggressive in life. Attack life with everything you've got.
* Some people feel entitled to their cheese. (Hems)
* Initiate change while you can rather than react to it.
* Each company has all for mice. Recognize and use them appropriately.
* Hope is exciting - it helps you get past fear.

I think what has made this book successful is it's easy to relate to the characters. Everyone can identify with the different emotions the characters dealt with and their responses to change. In reality, we all react to situations differently. How we react to change depends on our investment or risk associated with the change. The more risk or the more we have invested into the situation will inevitably determine how we act if the situation changes.

Let's assume that our TV breaks. The replacement cost is $400. We'll act like Sniff and Scurry and immediately go buy a new TV. On the other hand, if we lose our job, we may act more like Hem or Haw - complain and feel entitled to the job. We have much more invested in our job than our TV.

Who Moved My Cheese encourages you to be proactive in life, to not fear, and to welcome change. In today's world, dealing with change effectively is critical. Who Moved My Cheese is arguably more relevant today than it was when it was published in 1998.
