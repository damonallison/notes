# Photos Strategy

## Principles

* Own your own data. Online services are truly secondary storage, not primary.
* Native resolution.
* Simple consolidation. No need to connect devices (except camera).

## System

* All devices backup to Prime Photos.
  * Native resolution.
  * Unlimited picture storage.
  * 5GB video may prove too limiting. Will have to connect devices for larger video.

* Prime Photos -> Apple Photos
  * Simple editing / adjustments / management.
  * No pro features needed (i.e., Lightroom).

* Apple Photos -> Backblaze
  * Offline backup.


## Process

* iOS Devices -> Prime Photos
* Prime Photos -> Apple Photos (Manual process)
