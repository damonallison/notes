# Agile #

* It all comes down to vision. Ultimately, you need to have a product vision.
  People need to have confidence in what they are building and take pride in
  building it. Confidence comes from understanding the goal. All groups under
  a product need vision as well - marketing, engineering, external partners.

* Visibility and planning is **really** important. Engineering needs to distribute
  their current progress, how they track towards goals.

* People like stories - helps them understand why they are doing what they do.
  Can you tell stories and inspire people?

## Day 2 ##

### Project mapping (goal / user walkthrough / lower level tasks) ###

* Don't work on tickets, work on use cases. Working on ticket numbers kills
  the talk about product. (I'm working on ticket 24532) Don't fall into this
  trap. Keep your eye on the goal (i'm working on simultaneous document
  editing) and how each ticket plays into the overall goal.

* Stories are important. Use cases are important. Why? They make you think
  about the goal (wame with TDD).

* Vision, goals, and having a clear understanding of each is key. A story
  helps clarify the vision / goal.

* Capture, summarize, and iterate back what you hear from people.

* Stop discovery at the program level - not the class diagram level (don't dig
  down to the depths right away)

* Use case planning / mapping : 5-6 people, all departments. Talking thru
  scenarios and stories. The stories are not difficult to write, but it
  ensures people are using the same terminology. Terminology and making sure
  everyone follows the same terminology is important.

* It's difficult to think thru to the end from the beginning. TDD makes you
  think about the goal.

* Status meetings across teams. Less of a status, more interaction. If you
  aren't engaged, it won't work. Resurface just the important things. Goals,
  discovery and exploration, not a status update. People have to care or it
  will be worthless (make sure you care).

* Cross team unit testing : can the Apple code run against `pro_core`? Can we
  teardown / restart `pro_core` and determine when it's available? After that,
  we should be able to use the API. That type of integration test would really help.

* Google : 30% infrastructure - always.

* Google : "How do you measure innovation?"
  Answer : "If we don't fail 1/5 times, we didn't try hard enough"

* If you could be like any other company, which would you be? Apple? Google?
  Intel? NASA?  Why?

* The product owner owns the vision - engineering owns the product delivery.
  PMs should not just serve up requirements for the teams. The PM will blow
  up. Engineering team takes pride and ownership and looks to improve the
  product - not be order takers. Both sides need to work together.

* Discovery based standups, not status reports.

* Be insanely simple. Less is more.

### Multi-Group ###

* Get on the same schedule and use the same terminology early on.

* Each team has to be functional by itself in order for cross-team function.
  Putting two disfunctional teams together won't create order - just compound
  disfunction.

* How do you do cross-platform testing?
  * You could base it on API boundaries.

## Day 1 ##

* You need to specialize and focus.

* Estimations and planning are more sloppy than programming. And you will be
  wrong estimating more than you will be at programming. It's hard for
  programmers to adjust and admit their estimates are wrong.

* You know, has any engineering team's process **ever** been seen as
  successful? Why are all engineering teams considered broken by default? It's
  always *better better better*, has anyone ever said "our
  process has worked really well!"?

* Before you cut (estimate), you need to measure. In order to measure, you
  need to know what you're estimating.

* Retrospectives need to be about participation / problems. People need to
  bitch or nothing will change. If you don't know where you're going, you're
  screwed. We also need to talk about where we are heading.

* People are the most important.

* More complex == more uncertainty. Remove uncertainty. More uncertainly,
  lower velocity.

* Allegiance to your manager, not your product, doesn't scale. Fight to keep
  people attached to the product.

* "Problems communicating" is crap. What are the actual problems and what are
  the mechanics to resolve. (QA does not understand which builds to use and
  when they will be available. Formalize the build process and schedule and
  have everyone confirm they understand without ambiguity)

* Prioritize products before teams. Customers don't care about teams, they
  care about products. Products should be the top line entry.

* What does "done" mean? No vision == confusion.

* Group around purpose. Ask yourself : how are teams form? Around a product?
  Feature? A platform? What's your purpose (vision)?

* Context switches are killer.

* Is metrics / progress clearly defined and clear to everyone? Just be as
  transparent as possible.

* Don't build teams around work (people won't be committed). Build work around
  teams (people feel committed).

* Estimation boils down to confidence. Confidence == better estimates.
  Confidence comes from understanding.

* Everyone should estimate the same. One point is the same across teams.

* Don't know how somehting is going to work? Spend time in discovery (spike).
  Limit discovery to 10% - the first part of delivery is used to refine the
  estimate. Don't just start coding and don't over-analyze.
