[The Magpie Developer]https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/)

It's been almost 10 years since Jeff Atwood wrote about "Magpie Developers" - one of my favorite blog posts written. It has not only stood the test of time, but becomes *more* relevant as time goes on, the industry broadens, and the rate of change grows. Today we have such a massive technology industry - orders of magnitude larger than in 2008.

2008 to 2017 : The industry broadens

In 2008, the prime "web 2.0" days, we started to see the emergence of dynamic languages and web frameworks driven by ruby, rails, python, django, and javascript frameworks.

In 2008, you could switch between web frameworks, go from Java to .NET to ruby. Today, there are entirely new divisions of technology which Magpies can switch between. iOS, Android, Web, IoT, data science, machine learning, cloud, etc. Each of these industries are their own galaxy, with their own tools, languages, thought leaders, consulting companies, training materials, etc. You could become a magpie in a single industry by itself - let alone switching between industries.

A magpie developer is constantly distracted by shiny, new things, which provide no or marginal advances from the previous thing. They move from thing to thing, in attempt to distinguish themselves in the industry. "Things" include programming languages, tools, libraries, paradigms, social networks, news sites, etc.

Stop and seriously think before you make a change to the latest framework, latest language, library, or tool. Is the change advancing the products you build? People don't care about the tools you use to create the product. They care about the product.

An interesting question is this : why do engineers become magpies? What is the
underlying motive to move from tool to tool? To bounce between social networks?
To get caught up in the tidalwave of new javascript frameworks?

I think it's a combination of the innate desire to succeed (good) in tandem with
the fear of missing out (bad).

Are all the
new tools proposed in the industry better than the tools that came before? Of
course not. However in aggregate, tools today are better than tools used 10
years ago. Tools 10 years from now will be better than today.

The doesn't stop with programming languages or tools. Jeff
