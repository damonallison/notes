"Not even close to the iOS version. This let's me see which files are backed up, but the usefulness of downloading files to my WP8 device seems extremely limited. I was able to view downloaded jpg images and that was it. I couldn't do anything with Office documents downloaded to my phone- no viewing, no sharing, no editing; just a popup saying "Sorry, that format is not supported". But somehow the iOS app let me view Word docs, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks on my iPhone. So this app seems to have no use aside from confirming my pc's backup status. Not sure whether this is a developer or OS problem but they need to at least get to parity with iOS before I can even give three stars."

"Glad its here but basic. I know the viewers are a limitation of the OS (can't hand off files to OS) but they should be improved. Can't even view a word docx"
