# Apple Wish List

* First party swipe keyboard. 3rd party keyboards crash, are slow.
* Text based .xib files, ability to edit, create via XML or JSON.
* Open source Xcode.
* Much better Xcode plugin architecture. Create a more vibrant 3rd party community.
* Standalone app updates. Separate update interval from iOS. Put apps on their own update interval. Keep refreshing apps thru the year on different intervals (control the media).
* iCloud
  * A single storage bucket for all media. (iTunes Match)
  * Cloud storage to match device storage.
* Humility.
  * I'd like to see Apple lose their image of superiority.
    * Apple needs to admit they have room to improve - especially in their cloud offerings.
* Open Data
  * Image recognition, Siri breadth and depth, maps features and quality, and cloud offerings are not nearly as good as Google.
