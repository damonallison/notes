#  Blog : Modules vs. Microservices
https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/modules-vs-microservices

## Characteristics of modularity
* Strong encapsulation.
* Well defined interfaces.
* Explicit dependencies.

## Microservice benefits
* Small projects, scale independently.
* Strong encapsulation.
* Well defined interfaces.

## Microservice challenges
* Operationalizing.
* Distributed logging / monitoring.
* Versioning becomes harder.

## Module alternative
* Same boundaries exist between components, owned by different teams.
* Modules can be type checked, services cannot (HTTP boundary).
* Dependencies are explicit.
* Transactions are easier.

## When to use microservices?
* When you are massive, like Google.
* Need different technology stacks.
* Need deployment flexibility, scalability.

* Start modular, move to microservices later.
