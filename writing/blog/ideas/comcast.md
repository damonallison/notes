The 1TB data cap has been frustrating for our family. We would like to backup our family computer, but will exceed the data cap. We've used a courtesy month already and want to keep our last in case of emergency. I personally check our internet usage every week to ensure we aren't close to our cap. 

It's easy to exceed our data cap. If someone accidentally shuts off the TV while a device is streaming, without shutting off the streaming device, it will continue to stream. An honest mistake, but it will happen. This is how we exceeded our data cap the first time.

I realize you want to reduce traffic on the network. I also realize that for an extra $50 a month I can have unlimited data. Paying $110 a month for the most basic internet plan is too much.

I wish you would revert to unlimited by default or raise the monthly cap to impact only those who are abusing the network.
