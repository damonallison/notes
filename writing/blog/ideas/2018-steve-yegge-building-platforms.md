# Blog : Building Platforms
* [Stevey's Google Platform Rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)

> Services make thousands, apps make millions, platforms make billions. - Mitch Coopet

## Main Points
* Amazon has poor engineering standards across the company. It varies by team.
* Amazon has a great library versioning system, pub-sub system.
* Amazon prioritizes for shipping. Giving them a competitive advantage in the short term, pain in the long term.
* Jeff Bezos is a control freak. A micro-manager.

## Bezos' mandate
* All teams must communicate through service interfaces. No directly reading data stores, etc.
* All service interfaces must be designed to be consumed by the outside world.
* Internal teams start to DOS your services. You need quotas and throttling.
* Companies with so many services need to have a service registry and discovery mechanism.
* SOA architecture is the right thing since SOA design enables platforms.

> ‚ÄùBut Bezos realized long before the vast majority of Amazonians that Amazon needs to be a platform."

* Platform development has to be ingrained in your company's culture. You can't bolt on platform development into a product company. It has to be a priority.
