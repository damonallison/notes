# Andy Stanley : creating high performing teams

## Hire well - position them well

* Hire doers, not thinkers. Performance oriented people.
* Put best people on your best opportunities.
* Position people in the right place to make maximum impact.
* Sports teams know exactly their role, their job, the team goals. So should your team!
* Internal infighting takes sideways energy. Focus on the customer and the outcomes.
* Build emotional connection to the corporate mission.

## Clarify the what and the why

* Why are we here?
* What are the goals?
* Clarity around what and why clarifies what is not important. Drop anything not aligned with the mission.
* Leadership must make the vision clear.
