# Blog Post : Want Passion? Go to war.

## Steve Jobs
* Original Mac team
	* Why join the navy when you can be a pirate?

## Steve Yegge
* [Why I left Google to join Grab](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/why-i-left-google-to-join-grab-86dfffc0be84)

## Main Points
* Google is competitor focused with a sloppy product strategy which mostly all copy competitors.

* Why leave one of the greatest places in the world to work?
	* Inspiration / mission. Isn’t vision and passion the ultimate motivator?

> I have gone to war.
>
* We all want to feel like we are contributing to something great. That we are on a mission.

> I’ve seen Grab’s hunger. I’ve felt it. I have it. This space is win or die. They will fight to the death, and I am with them. This company, with some 3000 employees I think, is more unified than I’ve seen with most 5-person companies. This is the kind of focused camaraderie, cooperation and discipline that you typically only see in the military, in times of war.

* Good tech stack decisions: AWS / Go / Kotlin

### Why leave Google?

#### Google can no longer innovate.
* Conservative. Protecting what they have.
* Politics
* Arrogant
	* Success has bred a sense of invincibility, not invented here syndrome
	* Individuals are humble, the company strategy is a mess.
* Proof of their inability to innovate
	* Following the competiton
		* Google+
		* Pixel
	* Sloppy strategy.
		* Allo
		* Reader / Hangouts killed
* Google is 100% competitor focused, not customer focused
	* Google+ (Facebook)
	* Google Cloud (AWS)
	* Google Home (Amazon Echo)
	* Google Assistant (Siri)
	* Android Instant Apps (WeChat / Facebook)
