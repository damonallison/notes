# Photos for Mac OS X #

Apple's target scenario. Family of 5, 4 with iCloud accounts all bound together with family sharing.

* 5GB can be eaten up in a day. Even with aggressive management, 5GB is not nearly enough.


## Exporting from system lib -> non-sync lib ##

#### Option 1 : Export thru Photos ####

* Open "System Photo Library" -> Export Originals -> Open in non-sync library.

* Don't select and drag items to the desktop or folder. Movies are converted
  from .mov to .m4v.

* Export : com.apple.photos.VideoConversionService. Exported photos may
  actually be *larger* than the original, or converted into the exported
  format. We want the original photos, not converted copies.
