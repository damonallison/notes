# Every Good Endeavor

## Current State of Work

* Culture
* Identity
* Reality
  * Outwardly, people love their jobs.
  * Inwardly, work is an idol which fuels other idols (money, power, authority,
    control, security). People stuggle with work (research). "Work life balance".

## Need for Perspective, Mindset

* We need a new perspective at work, a new mindset towards work.
* Mindset is important, it shapes our lives, our decisions.
* Every Good Endeavor provides prospective. The history of work, the problems we
  have with work, and the Christian mindset for work.

## Introduction

* EGE is a Christian view of work, but the principles are agnostic.
* Tim Keller is Christian. He's an apologetic, a realist. Not religious or
  pretentious.

* Book Outline
  * Origins
  * Problems
  * Mindset

## Revisiting Why We Work

## Meaning

* Knowing that we were made to work, it has meaning, 
* It will always be a pert of our identity, who we are. We aren't different
  people at work. Fight "Dualism".
* Make your job a calling. A job is only a calling if you are working for
  something bigger than yourself. Christians work for God out of love for Him
  and others. 
* Corporations are putting purpose and mission ahead of profits.

## Mindset

* Reconsider why you work. What is your "North Star"?
  * Is it more imporant for you to work for others? A bigger paycheck?
  * If you had to choose only one, which would it be?
* Avoid negativity, cynicism, idolatry.

## Quality

* Do elite work. Don't cut corners.
* Have perspective. Work hard, but fight idolation. You can truly only do that
  when you are satisfied with what you have.
* Be grateful for what you have.

## Dealing with People

* Don't glorify your position or lower other positions. Respect everyone.
* Treat people well. Work is ultimately about people.
* Work is important. Like anything, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and
  lose perspective. Take the time to put your work and your mindset toward work
  into perspective. We spend a lot of time at work, we should enjoy it.
