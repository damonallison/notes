Give your mind a break: use checklists

Human brains are a lot like computers: our cache (brain) fills up. In today’s fast moving world, we are consistently bombarded with distractions, reminders, things to do, appointments, activities, grocery lists, workouts, chores, and so on. The more we can clear our minds the more focused our work. Focus is the key to productivity, quality, and results.

What are strategies we can use to clear our minds? According to David Allen and GTD, achieving a “mind like water” means storing all our actions in a trusted system.

Like GTD, checklists help us clear our mental caches. Checklists simplify routine tasks by not having to activate our brain to remember required steps or worry about missing anything.

The checklist manifesto attributes routine success and predictability to following checklists. Whether it’s remembering all your items before leaving the house, preparing for a medical exam, or cooking a meal, checklists organize, prevent us from missing details, give people confidence, and can spark conversation.</p>

Today, we know more than ever but we still fail. The amount of what we need to know to be successful is overwhelming. It’s easy to miss a detail. Checklists remind us of details we often miss — even in routine work.

This book made me realize that most of what we do in our lives is routine. I look at a lot of pull requests during the day. I keep a mental checklist of common things that I need to remember — retain cycles, comments, unit test coverage, verifying static analysis results, and correctness. If I had a checklist for all of these issues, I’d certainly make fewer mistakes. Better yet, following the checklist would get me upset I had to even follow the checklist. I’d probably write a script to pass the checklist. Win, win, win.

I realized that I run thru a lot checklists in my head for routine tasks every day. Why not review a checklist for each?

* Morning routine
* Items to consider when planning my day
* PRs
* 1:1 meeting agendas / talking points
* Nightly routine

I thought the book’s premise and examples (pilots, restaurants, doctors, etc) were excellent. That said, I think the book had one primary fault — it was too verbose.

I read this book in a few afternoons. It could have been condensed down considerably. For example, I appreciate that Gawande, a doctor, took examples from various other industries to prove his point. The breadth of examples solidified his point, however the examples were too drawn out. Each example could have easily been a few pages rather than an entire chapter.

Years from now, looking back at this book, I’ll remember one thing: **checklists help you follow procedure, keep your routine strict, and allow you to mentally focus on the problem without worrying about making simple mistakes**. That and I’ll probably write a few more things down.

One thing that wasn’t in the book, but I think is interesting, is that checklists give you a feeling of success. Even if the first thing on your list is trivial, like make your bed, checking it off the list gives you a small sense of accomplishment and puts you on a daily path to success.

Do your brain a favor. Follow checklists. They will help you stay focused, worry less, and prevent simple mistakes.

## Notes
### Why do we fail?
* Ignorance. We don’t know how to do something.
* Ineptitude. We fail to apply what we know.

### Why Checklists?
* Improve teams.
* Improve communication.
* In face of the unknown and complex, trust in the power of communication.
* In complex situations with multiple experts, its critical to have them talk and sign off as a team.
* Remember simple, repeatable, but critical details better.
* Personal reasons : improve diligence. Diligence fosters success. People, by default, are not diligent.
* Checklists ensure routine but critical stuff gets done.
* Checks ensure people communicate and coordinate to solve routine problems — like landing a plane correctly or preparing for a medical procedure.
* Checklists help with simple problems, can aide in complicated problems by decomposing them into simple problems.
* Checklists establish a higher standard of baseline performance.

### How Checklists?
* Keep the points simple, effective and to the point. They should help, not distract people from solving the problem.
* Add steps for communication or sign off from all specialists involved. This pushes responsibility to the edges, to where it belongs. Putting control into a central authority (master builder) is not effective. It puts too much responsibility on the central authority, who doesn’t have the depth of knowledge that the specialists at the edges have.
* Checklists must be real world tested. The first version will always need editing.
* Review results. Why do projects / things fail? People don’t like to talk about failure.

### Adoption of Checklists
* Checklists are politically or culturally hard to introduce, especially when teams are established.
* Checklists invite protocol, people reject protocol by thinking experience is better.
* Keep them focused around a goal, not introducing process.

### Examples
* Construction : Improves communication. Avoids Master builder the people responsible for their specialty remain responsible. Checklists foster communication by establishing hand off points.
* Restaurant : Recipes ensure quality. Team pow wow before opening ensures team is on the same page for the night.
* Aviation : Accidents / crashes are reviewed and distilled into checklists.
* Health : Reduce accidents in the heat of the moment.
* Crisis : Government failed to respond to Katrina. Not enough power at the edges. Empower people at the edges of a complex problem.

### Action Items
* Ensure your workflow process (git, unit tests, etc) follows a checklist for quality.
* Automate as much of the process as you can. Focus on communication about the product, not the process. The process should get out of the way and allow the team to talk about the product.
* Effective teamwork is the ultimate goal. Use checklists to clearly define process, lay out communication points, reduce team contention.
