tl;dr — Have a growth mindset.

## The Story
We are creatures of habit. We like predictability and the comfort of knowing what’s going to happen next in life.​ Dealing with change can be hard. This evergreen best seller describes how different personalities deal with change and gives practical advice on how to embrace and succeed in an ever-changing, fast paced world.

The story goes like this: There are two pairs of mice stuck in a maze and need cheese for nourishment and comfort. Both sets of mice find cheese and are happy. One day, *the cheese is gone*! Their world is thrown upside down.

The first pair, Sniff & Scurry are mice who recognized change was coming and adapted quick. They went searching for new cheese.

The second pair, Hem and Haw, were comfortable in their daily lives with the cheese and were blindsided when it was gone. They became upset and frozen when change came — they expected things to never change and became frustrated and angry, unwilling to change. After time has passed, Haw started to wander away from Hem to find cheese. It was difficult for him, but he learned many lessons along the way. Those lessons become the life teachings we all can benefit from when dealing with change.

## The Lesson
The book resonates well because everyone relates to one or more of the characters. Everyone fears something. Everyone reacts to change differently. We see ourselves in the characters. And it’s not just about us — we know people represented by the different characters in the book.

This book made me really step back and think about what I value, fear, how I deal with change, and what I want to change. There is so much opportunity right now in engineering. So much opportunity to be aggressive, disrupt legacy industries, and invent. This book just reinforced and inspired me to get more aggressive in life.

**You don’t need to read the book to get value from it’s message.**

Think about your life! How do *you* deal with change? What is your cheese? What do you value in life? Your job? Your house? Your family? Your retirement portfolio? Your religion?

What would you do if your cheese was taken away? What would you do if you lost your job? Your house? Your spouse? Your money? Your health? Are you preparing yourself?

20 years after this book was published (1998), this lesson is more relevant than ever. The world continues to speed up. And let’s face it — it’s not going to slow down. Ever. Are you ready to embrace and capitalize on change? Do you have a growth mindset? Are you embracing and seeking out change?
