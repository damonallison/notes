# 2014-03-01: Living the Bible in the Workplace

March 2014, I attended a Men’s breakfast at [The Grove Church](https://www.mygrovechurch.org/) with guest speaker [Bill English](http://www.theplatinumgrp.com/employee/bill-english) who delivered a great talk titled Living the Bible in the Workplace. It was a fantastic presentation. Bill challenged us to think deeply about if and how our actions at work reflect our Biblical values.

Experienced engineers and scientists know that while computers are important, the most important skill we can master is dealing with people. Bill’s talk challenged us to think about we treat people at work, how we want our professional legacy to be remembered, and how we can focus our daily activities towards achieving success with our work and with our professional relationships.

The values we live by, our character, and the relationships we build are a few
of the most important aspects of our lives. Regardless of how hard you work or
what you achieve, how you act and treat others will form the basis for how you
will be remembered. They should be consistently reviewed. They serve a constant
reminder: think critically about how your actions line up with Biblical values
and how you can improve.

## Legacy

* How will you be remembered for your work? Like a boat, the actions you do
  leave a wake. What will you leave behind in your wake?
* What did you accomplish?
* Before you can be an effective teacher, you must earn respect from others.
* How did you treat others in the process?

### Examples

* Steve Jobs. Accomplished much. Didn’t always treat others well.
* Tony Dungee. Accomplished some, was great to others.

## To earn respect, be Integrated with people

* Connect authentically. Lean in to people. Listen before talking.
* Orient toward the truth.
* High achievers face reality and deal with it.
* Resolve conflict. The Bible clearly states we will have problems. If you want
  to help people in their relationship to God, you need to resolve personal
  conflict.
* Delivers results and finish well.
* Don’t be mediocre. Human tendency is to do just enough to get by. Fight the
  temptation to coast. Fight the temptation to blame others for mediocrity.
* Orient toward growth. Own your work. Don’t check out, check in. Be
  transcendent. Sacrifice yourself for the greater cause.

## Challenge yourself
* Do you take risks?
* If you want to walk on water, you have to get out of your boat (comfort zone).
* There is always risk. Take on risk.
* Are you coasting? Are you holding back?
