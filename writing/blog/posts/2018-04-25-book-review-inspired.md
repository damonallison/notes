## Background

By all accounts, software development has been wildly successful. Simply consider where technology is at today.

Look no further than the internet. We can find ~1,650,000 articles about random topics like Fly Fishing in 0.52 seconds.  We can provision a worldwide software infrastructure with a few clicks of a mouse.  We can receive precise driving directions and accurate ETA, taking into account current traffic conditions. We can point our cellphone camera at a random dog and find out the breed with 99% accuracy.  We pay people in universal currency and store the transaction in a global, distributed, incorruptible ledger. We ask a small cylinder to book movie tickets for Friday night, turn up the thermostat and recommend restaurants. Cars drive billions of miles fully autonomous. Software is handily beating the world’s best Go champion at his game. 

And it’s speeding up. AI is advancing ever faster given the petabytes of data being generated daily. At Google’s I/O keynotes from 2015 onward, Sundar Pichai and Google have consistently and relentlessly focused on their AI first mission. Satya Nadella calls today’s AI driven landscape the “4th Industrial Revolution”.  It’s the “AI revolution”. And it’s on. It’s been on for a while. It’s so on that governments are publicly and proudly declaring intent to “win” AI. China publicly declared a AI arms race, the US is responding.

There’s nothing that will slow the accelerating and brutally aggressive force of innovation. Software continues to eat the world. Technology continues to eat the world.

But you know what? 

> **Underlying all the success is a trail paved with failed projects.**

The unfortunate truth is the vast majority of software projects fail. Judging from , it appears people have [tried](https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail/) to measure [failure](https://www.cio.com/article/3068502/project-management/more-than-half-of-it-projects-still-failing.html), but I’m skeptical of the accuracy. Even if you interview 1000’s of people, how could you consistently label projects as successes or failures? I’ve been on individual *teams* where many hours were spent “defining what success means”. Heck, even “defining what done means” is something I’ve seen teams struggle with.

Still, the trends are clear and indisputable. 

> **The majority of software projects fail**.

With that backdrop, let’s dig into what we’re here to talk about: Marty Cagan’s book [INSPIRED](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507).

### INSPIRED

The single question this book seeks to answer, the holy grail everyone in tech is searching for, is this:

> How do you create successful tech products?

Sounds easy, right? We’ve seen the countless success stories. The IPOs. The VC investments. The launch parties. The TechCrunch articles. We read books like INSPIRED, click bait LinkedIn headlines claiming the “5 steps to build a successful startup”. 

I’ve heard a bunch of common themes through the years. And in many cases, successful products have come from these approaches:

* Just hire a bunch of smart engineers and let them loose.
* The best products come from “scratching your own itch”. Focus on something in your life that’s broken, fix it, and sell it.
* It’s all about open source. Open source your project and the community will help build it.

While I believe there is a hint of truth to all of those approaches, the bottom line, and INSPIRED agrees, is that **there is no magical formula for success**. We can’t open our browser and search “best practices for successful software projects”, follow the guidelines, work hard for a few months, and have success. It doesn’t work that way.

INSPIRED distills down the essence of what author Marty Cagan has seen over his career working with mostly tech companies. He focuses on creating “tech” products, not manufacturing, or how to start a bakery, however the principles behind success are universal. He rightfully focuses on tech because all companies are tech companies. Even your bakery needs to embrace tech.

So, let’s answer the question, shall we? 

**How do we create successful tech products?**

I’ll summarize the main points of the book as a series of “Greats” from the most important to the least important. But truly, they are all important.

### #1: Great Culture

I’m cheating on this review. I’m starting from the end of the book. The last part of the book, Culture, in my opinion is by *the* most important.  I’m not sure why this was left until the end. Perhaps it was for a grand finale, who knows. Save the best for last philosophy. But in it, Cagan agrees that culture is the most important trait for successful tech products.

> **It’s all about culture**

This, my friends, is it. The holy grail of successful tech companies. You can stop reading this post right now and you have 90% of what you need to know about how to create great products. Culture is the root from which all things good and bad grow. 

I realize that customers don’t buy your culture. They buy your products. A skeptic would say, and on the surface I would agree, if you don’t have a compelling product that customers love, it doesn’t matter how good your culture is. You need to focus on the product vision and the product itself - after tall that is what sells!

While I agree you need to make a great product, how does the product get made? Culture is the underlying fabric upon which products are built. How people are hired. How motivated and inspired the team is. How product decisions are made. Culture helps engineers decide if they are going to spend the next few hours digging into a bug or call it quits for the night.

**Every company has a culture. Every. One.** 

So before we start talking about the formula to create great products, we need to define the environment and framework in which those products will be built. You need to ask yourself the hard questions.

* Why does your company exist?
* What’s your North Star? 
* What does your company value? 
* Does every employee know the company mission and values? Do they live them?

INSPIRED lays out characteristics of “good” and “bad” cultures. Obviously your company doesn’t need to check off every item on the “good” list, but in aggregate they give us a picture of what successful and unsuccessful teams look like. 

#### Good cultures
	* Obsess over their customers.
	* Have a product mindset.
	* Passionate about the solving the problem. 
	* Have an attitude that they are “going to war”.
	* Have an inspiring product vision they are working towards.
	* Are data driven. Instrument their work. Analyze the data.
	* Rapidly prototype.
	* Measure success by results.

#### Bad cultures
	* Obsess over their competition.
	* Hold roadmap meetings.
	* Consider reporting and analytics a nice to have.
	* Have lifeless “agile” ceremonies and measure success in “points” and completing the roadmap.
	* Design by committee.

### #2: Great People

I love the quote INSPIRED includes from John Doerr.

> We need teams of missionaries, not mercenaries. - John Doerr

Hiring great people is the mark of a great leader. Thankfully, smart people are drawn to great culture. If you build a great culture, chances are you’ll attract great people. 

Once you hire great people, you need to set them up for success. Instill in them a product vision they can become a missionary over - something they are passionate to attack. 

We also need to organize them. This involves teams, politics, communication, and corporate structure. This is critical to get right. INSPIRED lists traits successful teams have. 

#### Successful teams…
* Are given clear objectives.
* Must be empowered.
* Must be accountable. They need to feel ownership.
* Are responsible for their *outcomes*, not *outputs*.
* Are autonomous.
* Minimize dependencies.
* Stay together. Relationships build and expertise deepens.
* Are co-located (together) when possible. 

I feel like if you look at that list, you are really talking about *trust* and *control*. You want teams to feel in control of their work. If they are going to take pride in their work, they need control of their destiny.

And if they are in control of a product, you need to *trust* them. Lack of trust tears down the sense of ownership and control that makes teams successful.

### #3: Great Product Managers

After culture and people, product leaders are critical to success. In order to be successful, projects need strong leadership. In INSPIRED, the product leader is called the “Product Manager”. You may have a preconceived notion of a Product Manager from past projects and companies. It’s important to understand how INSPIRED defines “Product Manager”. It may be radically different than what you are used to.

The Product Manager (PM) INSPIRED discusses is an all-encompassing product visionary who understands the industry, the market, the landscape, competitors, and the product they are building. They are inspiring, have vision, and are completely invested in the product’s success. They analyze data, love the details, and thrive on building the best product the world has ever seen. They dig in. They work hard with the team. They are passionate about their vision, their product, and their team.

I’ve personally worked with multiple versions of Product Managers over the past 20 years. I completely agree with INSPIRED and I really like the picture it paints of a successful PM. It’s hard to describe the inspiration and passion teams have when they are lead by a really good PM.

What I find interesting is that finding great PMs is so difficult. Most product visions are evolutionary, low risk, and quite frankly boring. They aren’t fully invested. INSPIRED talks about that when referring to “enterprise” companies. I agree. Enterprise companies can be risk adverse and evolutionary. The “enterprise” mindset opens up a great opportunity for people like you and I to help these companies adopt INSPIRED like product development.

To reinforce the book’s strong Product Manager thesis, there are many interludes in the book with successful PM’s from Apple, Google, Ebay (where Cagan worked), Netflix, and others. In all the interludes, the general theme is the PM “owned” the product, rallied the company, and delivered.

Here’s a not-so-hidden secret: People *want* to give their lives to a cause. Elite teams have a mission far beyond money. Instilling that mindset the team is “going to war” motivates people to a level you don’t see in many companies. Product Managers are critical for creating and instilling that mindset and vision.

###  #4: Great Outcomes

> Most product roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations.

Many enterprise companies today build roadmaps. INSPIRED spends pages on why roadmaps are uninspiring and ultimately ineffective for creating great products.

Companies and products aren’t measured by how many project roadmaps they complete, how many teams they have, or how many “points” they finish every week. They are measured by outcomes. INSPIRED views today’s “Church of Agile”, where points are measured and “burndown charts” determine a teams productivity as not *nearly* as important as happy customers, increased sales, increasing usage, you know - actual *results*.

People, teams, products, and companies must be measured by outcomes, not outputs. INSPIRED really hammers on enterprise companies who are roadmap driven. I completely agree. Let’s get this straight: *completing a roadmap is not the goal*! Just because you finish a roadmap doesn’t mean a thing. What value have you produced? 

I like INSPIRED’s discussion of what’s wrong with product roadmaps:

* Half of the ideas on the roadmap won't work. The "value" isn't there.
* When projects are on a roadmap, they become commitments.
* It typically takes several iterations of a feature before it delivers business value. (Time to money)
* In order to tackle these risks, prototype ideas quick.
* You need to solve the underlying business problem, not implement features.

INSPIRED discusses using “Management by Objective” (MBO), where teams and individuals are rewarded based on objectives (Objective Key Results - “OKR”s), not completing projects.

For example, rather than giving a team the objective of “complete the on boarding project”, give teams the quantitive objective of “reduce average on boarding time to less than 2 minutes for a new customer”. Tell the team *what* the product should do, let the team decide *how* to do it.

### Great Process

Oh, here we go. Everyone’s favorite topic. Process. Agile. Scrum. Waterfall. Religion. Scrum masters. Agile coaches. 

Thankfully, you’re saved. INSPIRED doesn’t discuss Agile much (thankfully). INSPIRED focuses on the process of *product* development, not team execution. How refreshing. It’s so much more important to discuss the product development process (analyzing the market, understanding competition, creating ideas, etc) than the more narrow focused execution process that “Agile” teams typically follow.

I’m not saying that *execution* is not important - not at all. It’s very important. It can be life or death. But in the grand scheme of things, we are here to develop products. We could have completely automated, bug free code which ships to customers every 5 minutes. The best agile ceremonies, point tracking, retrospectives, stand ups, “burn down” charts, etc. But if nobody uses the product, none of that matters.

INSPIRED discusses the process of developing *products*, which feels like is dwarfed in attention by *execution* and *agile* by an order of magnitude in today’s “Agile Coach” driven corporate development cultures.

This process is meant strictly for product managers who own products. As engineers, QA, DevOps, or anyone else on the team, these are equally important to understand.

So, what are the traits of a great product development process?

* Spend time on discovery.
	* Collect evidence about what will work for the customer, engineering, and business.
	* Customers don't know what is possible.
	* Validate ideas on real customers (prototypes).
	* Validate business feasibility. Just because our customers love it, engineers can create it, does it work for our business? Can we sell it, maintain it, does it work for legal, etc.

* Access opportunities
	* What business objectives does this solve? (Objective)
	* How will you know you succeeded? (Key results)
	* What problem does this solve for our customers? (Customer problem)
	* What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market)
	* Pre-write your press release. What would it say?

* Cultivate product ideas
	* Story mapping
	* Find six reference (prospective) customers. 
		* Have them guide the product development. But don't customize the product for each customer. You are building a general product.
	* Do customer interviews.
	* Pretend you are the customer using your product.
	* Hack days.
	* Prototype.

* Use reference customers
	* Reference customers are chosen partners (actual customers) who agree to provide feedback and assist development.
	* Reference customers are powerful. They provide feedback, act as a reference point for the product team, and helps sales tell stories.
	* Reference customers act as a barometer to determine how successful a product will be. If reference customers don't love your products, nobody will.
	* Your product must be proven to make your reference customers successful before taking it to the broad market.
	* Reference customers must invest time and partner with you. They must be serious.
	* Do *not* customize your product for any one customer. You are creating a general product.


Overall, I really appreciated the book’s focus on product development. As I was reading, I didn’t have an “ah ha” moment where I learned something radically new. Each point by itself makes complete sense. Yes, we need vision. Yes, culture is critical. Yes, product managers must own their product. Yes, we must collect feedback, analyze the data, and improve.

But taken as a whole, INSPIRED painted a great picture of what characteristics successful products, teams, and companies embody. 

For me personally, INSPIRED opened my eyes to the broader context of overall product development. For so many years as an engineer I’ve focused on such a small but critically important piece of the product development process - coding. As engineers we typically focus on learning the next library, language, framework, service, component, or database that we miss the broader picture. Successful software products are built with great cultures, by great people, lead by visionary product managers, are outcome focused, and have a holistic product focused process.  

As I approach new products or companies, those are the traits I’m going to look for and help build.

* Inspired is about how large, successful tech companies are able to stay innovative and build great products.
* In order to build great products, build great teams.
* Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
* Focus on outcomes, not output.
* There is no template for creating great products. You need to build a product culture.

## Robinson Lessons Learned

### Personal 

* Relationships are key.
* Make people feel like missionaries, not mercenaries.

### Company

* Strengthen the importance of product management and strategy.
* Invest in future growth.
* Delivery lead should be accountable, act as scrum master, roadblock remover.
* Add value, not complete roadmaps. A defined set of success criteria, business objectives (OKR) for each team.
* Disrupt yourself before others disrupt you.
* Build products. Market them internally and publicly.
* Start selling direct to customers.
* Have an "open by default" culture.
* Get product, marketing, technology together to define the strategy.

## Part 1: Lessons from tech companies
* Behind every successful product is a great product manager. 
	* The book defines Product Manager as being an all encompassing product visionary.
	* The book defines a Product Owner in the Agile sense - a backlog planner.
* Product management is critical to success. It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they aren't building the right product.
* All product managers want to create great products. Still most products are not inspiring.

#### Startups
* Those that succeed are good at product discovery.
* Startups are racing to product / market fit.

#### Growth stage
* 25 - 100 engineers.
* Teams complain they don't understand the bigger picture.

#### Enterprise companies
* Many hold on past success, on a death spirial.
* Low morale, lack of innovation, design by committee, slow.

### The root causes of failed product efforts

* Traditional enterprise software has a long waterfall of ideas, business case (ROI), roadmap, requirements, design, engineering, QA, release.
* The only agile part of traditional engineering projects is the engineering part.
* Why roadmaps? 
	* Prioritization, planning.

#### Problems with the enterprise development model

* The process of bringing a product to market is slow and waterfall driven. Why?

* Sales and shareholders drive the roadmap. Not engineers. Engineers are mercenaries, not invested.

* Business cases are a guess. Nobody knows how much a product will make. We also don't know how much money / time it will take to build.

* Most product ideas don't work. Enterprise companies take a long time to realize that.

* Successful products aren't done when they initially ship. They take several iterations.

* Product managers are typically just project managers - managing stories and points - disconnected from the product.

* Customer involvement is way too late.

## Enterprise Companies: Consistent Product Innovation
* Enterprise companies kill projects which could reinvent the business, put up obstacles towards new ideas.
* Most products fail. The products that could make it take multiple iterations.
* Engineering is brought in way too late! Bring them in early. Engineers are great product innovators.
* Think in terms of products, not projects! Focus on products.

### Successful products have the following (beyond lean and agile)

* Risks are tackled up front.
* Products are defined collaboratively, with product, design, and engineering working together, not independently in the waterfall model.
* It's about solving problems, not implementing features.

### Key concepts of modern product work

* Holistic product. Think about everything from engineering to UX to sales.
* Continuous discovery and delivery. 
* Collaborative. UX, product management, engineering working together to determine what will be successful in the market.
* Multiple prototypes (10-20 per week).
* Product vision is defined with objectives 2-10 years out, relate to company mission.

## Part II : The Right People

### Principles of strong product teams

> It's all about the product team.

> We need teams of missionaries, not mercenaries. - John Doerr

* You want people who believe in a mission, not those who do what they are told.
* Teams are given clear objectives.
* Team empowerment and accountability. 
* Teams are responsible for their `outcomes`. They need to feel ownership.
* Teams are autonomous.
* Minimize dependencies.
* Keep teams together. Relationships build and expertise deepens.
* Teams are co-located (together) when possible. 
* Its critical for the head of product and the head of engineering to be aligned.

### The Product Manager
* The product manager must be strong. Not a converted BA.
* Product managers are the next CEOs.
* Product managers need to convince the team why the product is worth building.
* Engineers need to push back on the PM. 
	* Make him/her convince them the product will be a success.

#### Traits of a successful PM
* Smart, persistent, and creative. A passion for building products.
* Deep knowledge of the customer.
* Deep knowledge of the data.
* Deep knowledge of the business.
* Deep knowledge of the market.

* In all the examples in the book, no products came from sales or users. 
* They were created and made successful by product teams.

* PMs should basics. 

### The product designer
* UX and UI are key to successful products. PMs and UX must be partners.

### Dealing with engineering
* You must have a strong relationship with engineering. They must respect you.
* Appreciate the demands of engineering.
* Share openly with engineers.
* Involve engineers in the pain customers face.

---

### People @ scale
* How do we keep product teams productive as a company scales?

### Leadership
* The primary role of leadership is to find, grow, and keep strong talent.
* Maintain a head of product. A director or principal PM.
* Leaders of technology
	* Understand design of entire system.
	* Have a strategy for managing tech debt.

#### Head of product - skillset
* Team development. 
* Product vision.
* Execution.
* Product culture.

#### Head of technology - skillset
* Organization. Retention and growing the engineering team.
* Delivery. Keep tech debt low.
* Evangelism. Participates in engineering community, partners, and customers.

#### Delivery manager role
* Removes impediments for teams.
* They can act as scrum Master.
* Delivery managers allow teams to move fast.

#### Structuring product teams
* There is no right way to split product teams!
* Align to investment strategy. Ensure you are investing in future revenue and growth products.
* Minimize dependencies.
* Invest in the core. Common componentry, tooling, and processes.

## Part 3 : The Right Product

What product should the team work on? 

* Produce results, outcomes, not projects, roadmaps!
* Most product roadmaps are the root cause of most waste and failed efforts in product organizations. 

### The problems with product roadmaps

* Half of the ideas on the roadmap won't work. The "value" isn't there.
* When projects are on a roadmap, they become commitments.
* It typically takes several iterations of a feature before it delivers business value. (Time to money)
* In order to tackle these risks, prototype ideas quick.
* You need to solve the underlying business problem, not implement features.

### Alternatives to roadmaps

The alternative to roadmaps is results. Give the team OKRs, goals, to reach. Hold them accountable.

* Why roadmaps at all?
	* Management wants to know teams are working on the most valuable thing.
	* Businesses need to make date based commitments. 
* Product teams must understand:
	* How do they fit into the company vision?
	* The product vision and strategy.
	* The business objectives.
* Tell the team the business objectives and let them solve it.
	* "Onboard new customers in 3 hours or less"
* Prioritize business results, not product ideas.
* Tell the team what you want, what the objectives are, let them figure out how.
* For date based commitments, make **high integrity commitments**. 
	* Don't make commitments too early. 
	* Do Discovery first - prototype, customer validation first, before investing. 
* In good companies, date based commitments are minimized.

### Product vision

* Vision is the most effective motivation tool.
* Vision is like leadership, it inspires.
* Strategy is like management, it helps us get there. 
* Vision should be inspiring, the product strategy should be focused.

### Principles of product vision
* Start with *why*
* Fall in love with the problem not the solution
* Think big with vision
* Obsolete yourself before someone else does
* Evangelize continuously and relentlessly
* Be stubborn on vision but flexible on the details - Jeff Bezos

### Principles of product strategy
* Obsess over customers, not competitors.
* Evangelize the product strategy.
* You can't overcommunicate vision.

### Product objectives
* Use an MBO system (management by objective).
* OKR - objectives and key results.
	* Tell people what they need to do, not how to do it. (Motivate people to succeed on their own)
	* Measure performance by results. (How to meaningfully measure progress)

### The OKR technique
* Objectives should be qualitative, key results should be quantitative, measurable.
* Results should be based on the organization's objectives. Don't let personal or team objectives dilute this.
* The team must feel accountable for reaching their objectives.
* OKRs should be issued at the product team level, not functional team (UX, engineering, etc)


## Product @ Scale
* In large companies, teams need more help understanding their teams objectives and how they fit into the organization objectives.
* Platform teams don't align with corporate objectives. Help them set objectives.
* At scale, management must ensure teams are aligned, each team understands how they fit into the organization, what they are there to contribute. 

### Product evangelism
* Use a prototype
* Show the engineers the customer pain
* Share your vision
* Share learning generously
* Share credit generously
* Learn how to give a great demo
* Do your homework. 
* Be an expert.
* Show your enthusiasm 
* Spend time with your team. With large companies, is hard to drive substantial change. But that is what good product managers do.

## The right process
* Do product discovery prior to engineering. Get your products in the hands of customers early.

### Principles of product discovery
* Collect evidence about what will work for the customer, engineering, and business.
* Customers don't know what is possible.
* Validate ideas on real customers (prototypes).
* Validate business feasibility. Just because our customers love it, engineers can create it, does it work for our business? Can we sell it, maintain it, does it work for legal, etc.

### Product discovery techniques

#### Framing techniques
* Is the team aligned? Does everyone agree on the business objectives?
* Identify the big risks.

#### Opportunity Assessment
* What business objectives does this solve? (Objective)
* How will you know you succeeded? (Key results)
* What problem does this solve for our customers? (Customer problem)
* What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market)
* Pre-write your press release. What would it say?

#### Discovery planning techniques to get product ideas
* Story mapping
* Find six reference (prospective) customers. 
	* Have them guide the product development. But don't customize the product for each customer. You are building a general product.
* Do customer interviews.
* Pretend you are the customer using your product.
* Hack days.
* Prototype.

#### Customer Discovery Program Technique

Creating great products is the most important goal of a company.

Reference customers are powerful. They provide feedback, act as a reference point for the product team, and helps sales tell stories.

Reference customers act as a barometer to determine how successful a product will be. If reference customers don't love your products, nobody will.

Your product must be proven to make your reference customers successful before taking it to the broad market.

Reference customers must invest time and partner with you. They must be serious.

Do *not* customize your product for any one customer. You are creating a general product.

There are few things as strong as a product manager who is good at marketing.

#### Discovery ideation techniques

Most product teams in large companies don't think about new ideas. They are given roadmaps to do.

##### Customer Interviews

Really understand the problems your customers have and how they deal with them today. Look for opportunity. 

##### Concierge test technique

You do the job your customer needs to do. Pretend you were the customer.

##### Customer misbehavior

Look for ways customers misuse your product. There lies opportunities.

##### Hack days

Hack days allow engineers to create and execute ideas. Many teams are given roadmaps and not allowed to think.

Hack days create a culture of innovation.

#### Discovery prototyping techniques

The goal with a prototype is to reduce risk, lower cost, and move fast.

Prototypes force you to think thru the product.

Prototypes focus the team communication and act as a collaboration focal point.

##### Feasibility prototype

Give engineers time to prove out new tech, algorithms, or dependencies. Engineering spikes to answer *is this possible*?

##### User prototype

Low fidelity prototype like a wireframe or high fidelity like a click thru.

##### Live data prototype
A small MVP version to collect feedback and/or prove it a major risk.

Very limited in scope, but usable for customers to get real work done. 

#### Discovery testing techniques

When doing Discovery, we are answering:
	* Value. Will the customer buy this?
	* Usability. Can the customer figure out how to use this?
	* Feasibility. Can we build this?
	* Business viability. Is this product viable for our business?

##### Usability testing

When working with us, use a high fidelity prototype. 

Remove the emotion from your love of the product. Be humble and open to new ideas.

Take time to understand the customer's problem and how they solve it today. 

When running the test, keep the users in "use mode" not "critique mode". Don't lead them and try not to jump in and help. 

You want to understand how users think about the problem and where your software is inconsistent with hour the user is thinking. 

##### Testing value

Will customers buy our product? It must be substantially better.

Use demand generation techniques (fake door demand test) to your product. Advertise new feature, when customer clicks on it, tell them it's in beta and ask them for feedback.

Perform qualitative testing.
	* Interview potential customers. Do they have the problem you think they have?

Perform quantative testing.
	* A/B testing.
	* Rely on analytics. All features need analytics!
	* Use data to drive product decisions.

##### Testing business viability

Will the product work for the business?
	* Marketing
	* Sales
	* Legal
	* Operations
	* Security


### Transformation techniques

Transformation is hard. Moving from roadmap driven teams to output focused teams is a cultural shift and a handoff of power and control from management to individuals on the teams. 

#### Discovery sprint. 

Spend a week discovering and exploring product ideas and solving business problems.

Discovery sprints can be used for new products or when the team gets stuck.

Discovery coaches are always ex product people who know how to build tech products.

#### Pilot teams

Not all people want to see change. Start new processes or organizational change with a single team. 

If successful, other teams will want to be a part of it.

#### Weaning an organization of roadmaps

Don't pull roadmaps out right away. Start by taking about the business outcomes. As time goes on, the outcomes will be the focus. Not the roadmap.

## Process @ Scale

Agile processes at scale can kill innovation.

The techniques that follow allow your company to consistently innovate at scale.

### Managing stakeholders

* Everyone thinks they are stakeholders. A stakeholder is someone who can veto your product.
* Build trust. Know your product and market, share openly what you know. Ensure then you have their concerns accounted for.
* Show your product early and often. Avoid potential rework.
* Don't get into an opinion war with a stakeholder. Bring data to backup your product decisions.

### Communicating product learnings.

Tell the "big learnings", not small details.

It's critical the organization understands discovery and innovation is about continuously running experiments.
