# Hit Refresh : Satya Nadella

I started writing software professionally in 1999 during the height of Microsoft's Windows and Office dominance. I was invested deep in the MS stack - Visual Basic, C++, COM, ASP, SQL Server. While it has been almost 20 years, it feels like yesterday. Windows 2000 was on the horizon, which would bring with it the NT kernel. Microsoft was well into the process of integrating Internet Explorer into Windows, creating their own web "standards", following an "embrace, extend, extinguish" mentality for dealing with industry web standards. They publically denounced anything that would even threaten the Windows ecosystem. They developed strategies and media responses to Linux, Open Source, and the Free Software Movement which were ultimately leaked to the Open Source community and published online as the [Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents). 

In 1999, Microsoft was invincible. They had literally no competition in the desktop OS space. While there were alternative open source productivity suites, they couldn't rival Microsoft Office's ubiquity. There were definitely seeds being planted in the industry which, when looking back, would prove to challenge their dominance in the long term. For example, Google was founded in 1998. Amazon had IPO'd in 1997 and were in hyper growth mode. Apple was working on integrating NeXT into what would become Mac OS X and eventually iOS. Bill Gates was comfortably in control of his Titanic - and it was "full steam ahead" for Microsoft. The iceburgs were nowhere in Microsoft's sight.

Over time, we saw Microsoft's dominance being attacked on multiple fronts - both external and internal. Rumors of internal politics grew. Linux grew and dominated web and cloud infrastructure. Open Source became dominant. The web made the underlying OS less relevant. Microsoft, while early into mobile, lost to iOS and Android.

When Nadella took over CEO role from Ballmer in 2014, Microsoft was, on paper, growing. Revenues were strong. But it was clear they were riding inertia of products past. From a competitive standpoint, they were not [a threat](http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html).

Today, in 2018, we're witnessing the fruits from one of the most massive cultural shifts ever made in a corporation. Microsoft has gone from closed to open. From desktop to cloud. From license to subscription. The entire soul of Microsoft has been transformed at the hands of Satya Nadella.

There is an old saying, originating from [Jeremiah 13:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+13%3A23&version=NIV) in the Old Testament that says

> Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.

Inertia is a powerful force. It's difficult to
