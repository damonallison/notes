## My road with Microsoft

Microsoft. Just saying the name conjurs up so many thoughts. Windows. Office. Internet Explorer. Bill Gates. Steve Ballmer. .NET. Visual Studio. Active Directory. Exchange. Bing. Halloween Documents. So many years, so many thoughts. Where should I begin?

First of all, know that Microsoft has had a big impact, both positively and negatively, across the past 20 years of my career. When I graduated college in 1999, I began writing software professionally in Visual Basic 6. I began to invest deeply in the MS stack - Visual Basic, C++, COM, ASP, SQL Server. I wanted to learn everything I could about the Microsoft stack. I enjoyed the developer ecosystem around Visual Studio, .NET, and Windows Server. For me, the tools just worked well together. I was able to create ASP.NET sites, small Windows Forms apps which tied into Active Directory, SQL Server, or Exchange. I felt I could code circles around friends of mine writing Java and dealing with multiple UI toolkits, middle tier "open" platforms, and various relational databases. I felt knowing one set of tools really well made me more valuable than having a cursory understanding of many.

In 1999 to say Microsoft was dominant was a severe understatement. They felt invincible. Microsoft had a 95% operating system market share. 95%. Office was equally dominant. Their server tools division (SQL Server, Windows Server, Exchange) was beginning to form. Their developer tools were very strong - starting with Visual Studio. Windows 2000 was on the horizon, which would bring with it the NT kernel. I was proud to be in the Microsoft ecosystem and felt empowered by the tools they created.

We all know that while they created dominant software, Microsoft has done a lot of evil, unethical things in their day. By 1999, Microsoft was well into the process of deeply integrating Internet Explorer into Windows in attempt to leverage their Windows dominance to dominate the web. They famously created their own web "standards" which worked only on IE, following  an "embrace, extend, extinguish" mentality for dealing with web standards. They would "embrace" the standard, "extend" it to work better or only on IE, then "extinguish" both other browsers from the market and the standards themselves. 

In the early rise of linux, I would say around 1997-2000, Microsoft publically denounced anything that would even threaten the Windows ecosystem. They developed strategies and media responses to Linux, Open Source, and the Free Software Movement which were ultimately leaked to the Open Source community and published online as the [Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents). They did not play with others. Microsoft, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and their corporate culture became arrogant, prideful, and ruthless. I definitely saw what was going on. I rationalized much of it away as "just part of big business". Deep down I didn't want to believe the company I invested so much time into, who created such great tools, would be so unethical. I had hope they would change.

Looking outside of Microsoft during that era, there were definitely seeds being planted in the industry which, when looking back, would prove to challenge their dominance in the long term. For example, Google was founded in 1998. Amazon had IPO'd in 1997 and were in hyper growth mode. Apple was working on integrating NeXT into what would become Mac OS X and eventually iOS. Still, Bill Gates was comfortably in control of his Titanic - and it was "full steam ahead" for Microsoft. The iceburgs were nowhere in Microsoft's sight.

Over time, from 2000 until today, we saw Microsoft's dominance attacked on multiple fronts - both external and internal. Rumors of internal politics grew. Linux grew and dominated web and cloud infrastructure. Open Source became dominant. The web made the underlying OS less relevant. Microsoft, while early into mobile, lost to iOS and Android. These are gross generalizations, and we could be here all day rehashing many more, but over time all these paradigm and industry shifts taken together have dramatically marginalized Microsoft. Today, Windows market share is less than 40%. Other markets - like mobile and search - are dominated by Google and Apple. 

It's astonishing. Here we are, 20+ years after the height of Windows dominance, and Windows has literally no presence in the largest OS market ever seen - mobile. That's unbelievable. 

## Executive transitions

I respect the success Bill Gates had with Microsoft. I admire his ambition, drive, and his late focus on philanthropy. Given how ruthless he ran Microsoft, I really didn't see his shift into philanthrophy coming. He's doing amazing work.

I personally feel Bill Gates made both the best and worst decisions of his career dealing with CEO transitions at Microsoft. 

Let's start with Ballmer in 2000. I realize that Bill and Steve go way back. Bill was the brains, Steve drove sales. They were a team. But why Bill put Steve in charge of Microsoft was beyond me. Bill is smart enough to know what happens when sales or finance people are put in charge of engineering organizations. They focus on deals, on sales, on the current quarter or year. Long term, you don't create quality products or advance into new markets. Product mindset (Amazon, Google) focus on the long term. Sales people focus on the short term. And new markets are long term bets. Sales people do not invest well in long term bets - it goes against their core values. Like it or not, Steve Jobs called it when he said:

> When sales people run tech giants, it's over. [2]

When Ballmer was titled CEO, Gates was still there. So in theory, he was behind the scenes focused on engineering while Steve was the face of Microsoft. Perhaps he thought he could focus on products and drive the engineering organization rather than focus on corporate business.

What I never understood is why he kept Ballmer in charge of Microsoft when he left to start his foundation. Perhaps Gates felt Ballmer's economic success was good enough to carry the company into new markets. But didn't Bill see mobile (or cloud, or AI) coming and know that Ballmer didn't have what it takes to pivot the company? It's all speculative, and hindsight is perfect, but I certainly thought Bill would have seen their dominance slipping with Apple, Google's growing dominance and instill a strong engineering focused CEO to compete with them.

Appointing Nadella:

* Product person, a visionary.
* Perhaps Ballmer and Gates were humbled enough to realize  


When Nadella took over CEO role from Ballmer in 2014, Microsoft was, on paper, growing. Revenues were strong. But it was clear they were riding inertia of products past. From a competitive standpoint, they were not [a threat](http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html).

Today, in 2018, we're witnessing the fruits from one of the most massive cultural shifts ever made in a corporation. Microsoft has gone from closed to open. From desktop to cloud. From license to subscription. The entire soul of Microsoft has been transformed at the hands of Satya Nadella.

There is an old saying, originating from [Jeremiah 13:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+13%3A23&version=NIV) in the Old Testament that says

> Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.

Inertia is a powerful force. It's difficult to 


* Today is a "new Microsoft".
