# 2015-07-04: Wheelmen Reading Notes
My raw notes from the book Wheelmen.

> Nearly all men can withstand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power. — Abraham Lincoln

## Introduction
* When Lance Armstrong admitted to doping after years of aggressively lying, he didn’t reveal the details of who helped him dope, where he got drugs, how severe his usage was, and the tricks he used to evade drug tests and anti-doping authorities.
* Cycling was dominant in European countries. Until the 1970s, it was a working man’s sport. It was not glamorous nor did riders make much money.
* When the U.S. got into cycling, the landscape changed. They commercialized it. Greg LeMond made cycling’s first $1 million salary in 1991. Armstrong earned $4.5 million in 2004, which was small compared to his endorsement deals.
* There were a small group of Americans who wanted to turn the US into a major cycling player.
* Armstrong was brought up in a comfortable, middle class home. He was self-indulgant. He craved attention, support, and reassurance. Lance reads extensively, including everything written about him.
* In 2010, Floyd Landis exposed the US Postal team’s doping practices. Travis Tygart was the head of the underfunded US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and was responsible for going after Armstrong and his team.

## Chapter 1 : True Blue
* The author is showing an example of the power that drugs gave athletes thru an example of the 2004 TdF.
* July 2004: Armstrong 5 minutes behind the leader (Thomas Voeckler) on the most grueling day of the tour. After the first climb, they gained a minute on the leader. They were flying. Up the last climb of the day, they looked comfortable while other teams suffered.
* Landis explained (in 2010) the doping process used by the US Postal team:
* They started doing transfusions in 2001.
* Two blood transfusions per tour.
* Blood was taken from each athlete in spring or early summer.
In the weeks leading up to the tour, they did transfusions to improve training.
* Blood was transferred into France during the race by car.
* The people investigating wondered why Landis was telling them this. Landis’ life was shattered. He went thru a divorce.
* His relationship with Armstrong ended in a bitter feud.
* The book opens in the 2004 Tour de France. They were on stage 13 — a tough stage. Armstrong was 5 min behind the leader. The U.S. Postal team flew up the hills and crushed the field. The fans were cheering, some yelling “doper doper”. Landis was pulling for Armstrong. Even after Armstrong was well ahead in the overall standings, he still pushed hard to win the stage, beating a rider who was way back in the standings and just wanted a strong finish. Armstrong was proving he was tenacious or simply arrogant. Armstrong went on to win the TdF.
* After one of the stages, Armstrong would leave his team and fly off with his girlfriend (Cheryl Crow) for the night. Shows he was arrogant, full of himself. Feeling above his team.
* In 2010 Floyd Landis’ life was in rough shape. He gained weight, got divorced, and had a bitter break up with Armstrong. Landis confessed the drug charges and whistle blew on Armstrong.
* They told a story about faking a bus breakdown to do blood transfusions to evade the French police who accused the Postal team of doping.

## Chapter 2 : A new beginning for American cycling
* Eddie Borysewicz (Eddie). Came to America in 1976 after a divorce with his wife who cheated on him. He was a racer in the 50s and 60s. Was mis-diagnosed with tuberculosis. The treatment left him weak and unable to complete in the Olympics.
* He met Mike Fraysse, who was the top official in the 76 Olympic cycling events.
* Started training cyclists &#8211; including Greg LeMond.
* Fraysse made Eddie the US National Team coach.
* In the 84 Olympics, the US started doping. They setup informal testing to allow the athletes to determine how long drugs stayed in their system.
* Jim Ochowicz: Started building a US pro cycling team. Och was an olympic speed skater. made the 72 and 76 Olympic team in track cycling. Och met Eric Heiden — Olympic speed skater. Och got Heiden into cycling. Built a team around Heiden. Started getting sponsors (7–11).
* Eddie’s Olympic and Och’s pro teams were overlapping for the 84 Olympic teams.
* Eddie and Och clashed. Eddie was a trainer. Och was a manager (sponsors, money).
* Eddie was OK with blood transfusions. He thought it wouldn’t cause long term harm, like drugs.
* Eddie was asked to coach a rich masters athlete named Thom Weisel. Weisel was a rich investment banker who went on to fund and manage many US teams.
* Weisel asked Eddie to make him national track champion in exchange for Weisel making Eddie a millionaire. Eddie did it — Weisel won the masters track championship. Weisel didn’t quite make Eddie a millionaire.
* After winning the masters championship, Weisel wanted to fund a national cycling team and compete in the TdF.

## Chapter 3 : A Rage to Win

* The TdF had rampant drug use. All teams were cheating. The French police were trying hard to catch the riders. The riders had to get more sophisticated. In 1998, the riders staged a “sit-in” to protest the French police.
* LeMond was upset that Thom Weisel (manager / investor in USPS) supported drug use. LeMond didn’t trust him (Weisel wasn’t ethical) and broke all ties.
* Weisel’s company was bought, so he got out of owning the USPS team.

* Armstrong trained for and won the tour in 1999. They were winning so big they stopped EPO mid race.
* LeMond was trying to encourage Armstrong, but Armstrong was not interested in LeMond. Armstrong thought LeMond could not help him and was not necessary to have around. He was rude to him.
* In 1999, Lance tested positive for drugs. He lied — saying he needed testosterone treatment for saddle soreness. He was let off the hook.

He won the 2000 TdF. The team doctors were caught disposing medical waste, including EPO and testosterone.
* LeMond was told that the postal team was doping. Also, the team paid $500,000 to Hein Verbruggen to cover up the 1999 positive drug test.
* In 2001, Lance was almost found EPO positive in a test. The test was later ruled too close to call. Armstrong blasted people that used drugs — calling them cheats who wanted to bring down the sport.
* Ferarri (Armstrong’s drug doctor) was convicted of trafficking EPO. Armstrong was forced to admit he was working with Ferarri in the past. Claimed Ferarri was training him, not offering drugs. Lance made up a story with his coach, Chris Carmichael and downplayed his role with Ferarri.

In 2005, the French had a test for EPO. They retested Armstrong’s 1999 samples and he tested positive.

## Chapter 11 : Adieu and fuck you
* Landis won the 2006 tour. When asked about doping he said “I’d say no”— which admitted he was guilty. He now had to fight the charges or come clean. He was being pressured to not come clean. He lost his title.

## Chapter 12 : The Comeback (again)
* In 2007 he started a lot of business ventures. He tried to buy the sport of cycling, but couldn’t make it happen.
* In September 2008, Armstrong returned to cycling. He was on a team with Contador for a while — then started the Radio Shack team.
* When he rode with Contador, Contador won the tour. But Armstrong was pushing himself to win as well — which ticked off Contador.
* Armstrong’s drug tests were more of the same : highly scrutinized, questionably off, and the UCI (who was paid off by Armstrong) defended him.

## Chapter 13 : Betrayals
* Landis denied doping for 3 years, went broke defending himself. Came clean in 2010 — speaking with Trais Tygert (USADA). Landis was the key whistleblower.

* Landis agreed to wear a recoding device to frame another questionable racing team (Rock Racing).

## Chapter 14 : The Chase
* Landis’ doping claims hit the headlines. Lance dismissed Landis as out for revenge. Lance hired a bunch of lawyers to fight the charges.
* From 2010–2012 A Federal Inquiry was took place. After 2 years, the federal investigators dropped their charges. Lance was not charged.
* The USASA couldn’t press criminal charges, they have the power to strip Lance of his titles. They started an investigation.

## Chapter 15 : Scorched Earth
* In 2012, Lance started racing triathlons. He was strong — winning and placing high.
* The Justice Department was considering joining Landis’ whistleblower lawsuit.
* The USADA could take away Lance’s titles and ban him from triathlon competition. Lance tried to countersue, but the judge dismissed it. He said if Armstrong was truly innocent, he should go to arbitration and fight.
* Lance did not challenge the USADA’s charges — saying that he was tired of fighting.
* Lance verbally accused the USADA of a witch hunt, and be-raided them.
* The USADA made their evidence public on October 10, 2012.
Even after the report was released, his sponsors stood behind him.

## Chapter 16 : Not a Snitch

* Lance admitted to doping on the Oprah show.
* The Justice Department joined Landis’ lawsuit.

## Epilogue
* The authors badger the American people for believing and supporting Armstrong while he was clearly lying — until they had no choice but to accept Lance was a cheat. And once the public turned on him, they turned hard.
* Lance could be back. He’s dedicated, determined, strong.

## Afterword
* Lance considers himself a hero. A hero for beating cancer and helping people.
* Some riders (Hincapie) are ticked that the USADA did this. He claims the investigation doesn’t help the sport.
