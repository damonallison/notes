# Book Review: Counterfeit Gods

Happy New Year! I'm writing this on January 1st, 2019. The day of the year where
millions of people make resolutions and set goals to change their lives for the
better. We can probably guess the top resolutions people make. Lose weight is
probably #1, exercise, eat better, spend less money, spend more time with family
/ friends, run a marathon, quit smoking, drink less, etc.

After literally typing in "top new years resolutions" into Google, we find a
[survey of 2000
people](https://www.ellipticalreviews.com/new-years-resolutions/) which reveals
the top New Years resolutions people make:

* 71% - eat better
* 65% - exercise more
* 54% - lose weight
* 32% - save more, spend less
* 26% - learn a new hobby or skill

Hopefully the actual resolutions are S.M.A.R.T. or have a much better defined
goal than those generalized goals, but you get the idea. It's all about
improving self image, finances, or generally improve yourself personally.


I couldn't think of a
better topic to write about on New Years Day than one which makes you look deep
into your heart and think about what truly motivates you.

For me, the best part of the new year is setting aside time to review the last
year and plan the next. Reflection, at least for me, is a great source of
inspiration. I examine the successes and failures, looking into the root causes
of both. I feel so often we do things - finish projects, take courses, read
books, spend time in relationships, etc, but we don't take the time to reflect
and truly learn from what we did. Only thru reflection and deep thought can we
truly learn and grow. You've spent countless hours *doing* things, take a few
minutes to *think* and *learn* from the time you've spent. Every minute spent
reflecting is worth a thousand times more than time spent actually *doing* what
you've done.

Of the successes, why were they successful? What were the traits, habits, or
thought process that made the successes happen? What struggles were overcome?
What lessons can be taken to less successful areas of your life? Was the success
worth the investment? We have a truly infinite amount of ways we could spend
the short amount of time we have on earth. Will those successes truly change the
trajectory of our lives for the better? 

Of the failures, which for me there are certainly more of, why did they fail?
What was my mindset like towards them? Typically, I fail to reach goals because
I didn't want to invest the time it would take to reach them. For me, it's a
matter of losing interest or not wanting something bad enough. Why didn't I want
this bad enough? If something more important came up, what made it more important?

It is my hope that this book review, especially at this time of year, gives you
perspective into the deepest desires and motivations you have in your life.
