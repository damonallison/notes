# Book Review: Counterfeit Gods

Happy New Year! I'm writing this on January 1st, 2019. The day of the year where
millions of people make resolutions and set goals to change their lives for the
better. We can definitely guess the top resolutions people make. Lose weight,
exercise, eat better, spend less money, spend more time with family / friends,
run a marathon, quit smoking, drink less, etc.

After literally typing in "top new years resolutions" into Google, we find a
[survey of 2000
people](https://www.ellipticalreviews.com/new-years-resolutions/) which reveals
the top New Years resolutions people make:

* 71% - eat better
* 65% - exercise more
* 54% - lose weight
* 32% - save more, spend less
* 26% - learn a new hobby or skill

Hopefully the actual resolutions are S.M.A.R.T.er or at least measurable (e.g.,
lose 10 lbs) than the generalized goals above, but you get the idea.

On the surface, those are great resolutions. Who wouldn't want to exercise more,
eat better? But stop for a minute and actually *think*. Why are they being made?
What are the deep desires which are motivating people to set these resolutions?
To me, it seems people value their appearance, their personal wealth, and
generally improving themselves. Without a doubt all great things.

What if the results turned out like this:

* 71% - give more
* 65% - donate time to a non-profit
* 54% - become a mentor
* 32% - invest more, save less
* 26% - teach a hobby or skill

Could you imagine what the world would be like if these were the actual survery
results? What an amazing culture we would have. Stop and think about the deep
desires behind these goals - investing in others, improving the lives of others,
a desire to give.

The deep desires which drive our lives, our thoughts, our actions, our feelings,
and our resolutions, are idols. Idols motivate us, they encourage us, they are
the lens thru which we view life, ourselves, our values, our political beliefs,
and others.

o I couldn't think of a better topic to write
about on New Years Day than one which makes you look deep into your heart and
think about what truly motivates you.

For me, the best part of the new year is setting aside time to review the last
year and plan the next. Reflection, at least for me, is a great source of
inspiration. I examine the successes and failures, looking into the root causes
of both. I feel so often we do things - finish projects, take courses, read
books, spend time in relationships, etc, but we don't take the time to reflect
and truly learn from what we did. Only thru reflection and deep thought can we
truly learn and grow. You've spent countless hours *doing* things, take a few
minutes to *think* and *learn* from the time you've spent. Every minute spent
reflecting is worth a thousand times more than time spent actually *doing* what
you've done.

Of the successes, why were they successful? What were the traits, habits, or
thought process that made the successes happen? What struggles were overcome?
What lessons can be taken to less successful areas of your life? Was the success
worth the investment? We have a truly infinite amount of ways we could spend
the short amount of time we have on earth. Will those successes truly change the
trajectory of our lives for the better? 

Of the failures, which for me there are certainly more of, why did they fail?
What was my mindset like towards them? Typically, I fail to reach goals because
I didn't want to invest the time it would take to reach them. For me, it's a
matter of losing interest or not wanting something bad enough. Why didn't I want
this bad enough? If something more important came up, what made it more important?

It is my hope that this book review, especially at this time of year, gives you
perspective into the deepest desires and motivations you have in your life.
