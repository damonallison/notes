Work is an increasingly important and demanding part of our lives. We spend more
waking hours of our lives working than we do with our spouses, families, or our
hobbies. Work forms our identity, is a source of pride and accomplishment, and
is of course a primary source of income.

But how often do we step back and put work into perspective? What are our goals
with work? Not to move up the ladder - what are our long term goals? When we
die and look back on our lives, what will we think of our work - the jobs we
did, the people we met, the struggles we overcame, the failures, how we acted,
etc.

Let's take a look at the current state of owrk

## Current State of Work

Culture

American culture and society rewards hard work, dedication, entrepreneurship,
risk taking, and success. It's hardwired into our minds early on. We tell our
kids they can do anything they want if they put their mind to it and work hard.
We idolize people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk who have literally given their
lives to their companies.

A work driven culture is not unique to America. China prides themselves on "996"
work schedules and demanding environments. 996 is unhealthy and insane - working
9AM to 9PM 6 days a week. China is also extremely ambitious. Their public goal
is to dominate technology and AI in the coming decade, making China the world
leader in advanced technology. Given their ambition, track record, size, and
resources, they will definitely be a leader.

We have an increasingly "always on" work culture . Work for many doesn't stop
when they get home. Technology has allowed us to take work with us. We check our
calendars when we wake up, email around the clock, and never turn our minds off.
As work has gone global it's become a 24-7 operation - there is no downtime.

Identity

There are very few activities we do in life more than we work. Many people spend
more time working many days than sleeping. We sleep 7 hours a night, we work 10
hour days. We answer work emails late at night and check our calendar the first
chance we get after waking up. We see our coworkers more than our spouses. If we
were aliens landing on the planet, we may think that life revolves around
work. Unfortunately for many people, that's a sad reality.

In America, and increasingly around the world, work has become an idol. Work has
become our source of identity, of confidence, of control, and of self-worth.
Life for many people *is* work. It *is* how we identity ourselves with the
world. 

Regardless of what field you're in, you're known largely by your work. "He's a
doctor", "She's a lawyer", "He's in computers". The truth is work *is* a large
part of our identity. And we work hard to build and convey our image.

Consider LinkedIn. People spend countless hours forming and crafting their
LinkedIn profile, posting messages to reflect their values, their ideal image. 

People post about how successful they are, how hard they've worked, the struggle
and pain they are going thru because of how dedicated and driven they are, how
great their company is, how being an entrepreneur and following your dream is
the key to success, how much my company values equality, diversity, ethics, etc.
From the outside, people love their jobs, their companies, and want people to
know it. 

Fallout

Inwardly, a different story is playing out. The American Psychiatric Association
(APA) is claiming that 40 million Americans, about 18% (1 in 5), have an anxiety
disorder. That's over double the world average. Acording to the World Health
Organization, 1 in 13 worldwide suffer from anxiety disorders. Still a high
number, but America is much higher than the world average. 

Why? Why are Americans so much more anxious and depressed? What are they anxious
about? While people are anxious about many different things, money and work are
numbers one and two - in that order. 

So while outwardly people love their jobs, the reality is work is one of the
leading forms of anxiety. And honstely, given the cultural importance we put on
work, success, "hustle", drive, etc, it's easy to see why. Money and work have
become cultural idols.

## Need for Perspective, Mindset

Like anything in life, too much of a good thing is not healthy. We need to put
work into perspective, into the broader context of life. Work is important and
we were made to do it, but I hope we collectively believe it's not the primary
goal of our lives.

Every Good Endeavor, by Christian pastor Tim Keller, examines the history, the
troubles, and mindset we should have toward work. Regardless if you are a
Christian or not, the history and perspective Keller brings will allow you to
examine how *you* view work, your mindset, and make you think about how you want
to change your mindset towards work. It puts work into perspective.


## Every Good Endeavor - Introduction

Every Good Endeavor examines the origins, problems, and Christian mindset toward
work. It helps put work into perspective by taking a step back and looking at
work as work from a broader context. It's easy for us to get wrapped up in our
day-to-day "grind" in our jobs and careers that we lose the big picture.

Tim Keller is a Christian pastor and founder of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in
New York City. He's an approachable, down to earth speaker and writer who
approaches Christianity from a skeptical point of view. He makes Christianity
approachable and understandable, avoiding complicated or overly religious tones
in favor of practical, bible based principles and teachings that have "down to
earth" appeal. He speaks directly to people's lives with the goal to generally
help, not an attempt to promote religion. He presents the facts, the Biblical
point of view, but ultimately leaves it to the reader to decide their truth.
In my opinion, his style is extremely effective.

You most certainly do *not* need to be a Christian to grow from this book. In
fact, the Christian mindset and values described in Every Good Endeavor are at
work and practiced, many times better, by non-Christians than they are by
Christians themselves. Regardless if or what religion you hold, the Christian
mindset towards work gives you another perspective from which you can pull ideas
from.

The book is broken up into three sections:

1. The origins of work
2. The problems with work
3. The mindset we should have toward work

## Part 1: God's Plan for Work (The Origins of Work)

For as long as there have been people, there has been work. But where does work
come from? Why was it created? 

God Designed Work

The book starts off with the Biblical origin of work. Work was created by God.
God himself worked. He created the heavens and earth, man and woman, all
creation. Because we were created in God's image, and God worked, we also work. 

Regardless of *how* work came into existence, we all realize work is a basic
human need that we have. We need to work. It gives us a sense of accomplishment,
of pride, and meaning in our lives. If we didn't have "a job", we would have to
do something with our time. Consider the person who dreamed of retiring. But
after a few months in retirement, boredom sets in. Human's weren't made to sit
and do nothing.

So why do many people *not* enjoy work? Why is work stressful? Why do we
struggle with work realted anxiety?

The Bible tells us that work was not designed to be toilsome labor. However
after Adam and Eve disobeyed God, sin entered the world. As part of this great
fall, work became difficult. Jobs became "work" in the toil sense, which is not
what God originally intended. He intended for us to enjoy our work, as He
enjoyed work. He designed work to be a source of happiness, fulfillment and
pride as it was for God himself.

God also rested, so should we. We must stop to enjoy the work we have done. That
is part of life. We live in a world which craves affirmation. It's easy to be a
workaholic, but we need to put limits on our work.

All Work Has Dignity

By many cultures, work was viewed as demeaning. Even today, many look down on
"low class" jobs, giving more respect to the CEO than the janitor.

The Bible tells us that God does not look down on anyone. Case in point: Jesus.
Jesus was a carpenter. Not a CEO or position demanding high organizational
authority.

The lesson here is to not look down on anyone. Respect those who clean the
floors as much as the CEO. All work has dignity the way God designed it.

Work as a Service

How to you measure success in the work you do? For many, it's by the size of the
paycheck. For others, it's about the respect you're given from others. For some,
it's about helping others.

Keller makes a point thru the book which I feel is powerful for us to reflect on
as we change our mindset toward work. Work should be a calling, not a vocation.
Work should be something that we do for others, not ourselves. Work only becomes
a calling if you do it for something bigger than yourself. It's here, in serving
others, that you find the most fulfillment, joy, and sense of accomplishment
from your work.

Today's companies have realized that purpose and mission are more impactful than
money and profits. People want to work for a mission, a cause, that is bigger
than themselves. For example, Satya Nadella is executing one of the most
successful corporate turnarounds in history by focusing on purpose, mission, and
empathy. Companies pride themselves on their ethics, values, and generosity.
They've also realized that what's good for people is also good for business.

Christian Beliefs

For Christians, Keller reminds us that we are saved by faith, not works. Jesus
came to save us, our battle has already been won. You can rest assured in your
work that regardless of how successful or not you are, you can't be more saved
than you are today. Knowing that, there is no reason to be anxious or worry
about work or money. Be humbly confident in your work.

Also, Christians realize that God provides work and we are working for Him. Only
your best will do. Christians should do their absolute best work, never cutting
corners, knowing they are working for God, not man.

## Part 2: The Problems With Work

In this section of the book, Keller lays out problems with work. 

Work Becomes Fruitless

Why is work hard? The Bible tells us it's because of sin. Sin permeates all
aspects of our lives, including our work. We will experience pain, envy,
conflict, frustration, and fatigue.

Work Becomes Pointless

The Bible is full of stories about how kings, who had everything they wanted on
earth, set out to find meaning in life. They tried to learn everything, spend
all their time on pleasure, and accumulate great wealth. Their conclusion was
even when they accomplished their goals, it didn't give them a meaningful life.

The only way to have a meaningful life is to work for others. Working for things
of this world is pointless. We can't take them with us when we die.

The Bible also gives us wisdom as to how to make work meaningful:

* Choose work that fits your gifts. Take an honest inventory of what makes you
  great, where you fit, and choose work accordingly.

* Choose work that benefits others. Watch out for unethical people and
  companies.

* Work to benefit your field. Make your industry better for the next generation.
  

Work Becomes Selfish

We've mentioned earlier how much more meaningful and impactful purpose and
mission are to job satisfaction and how companies are figuring that out.

Still, for many, work is about themselves. Our jobs become our source of pride,
power, and security. This leads to competition, envy, struggle, and ultimately
idolizing work.

In the Christian world view, everything you have has been given to you by God.
The country you were born in, the opportunities you have, the money you've made,
the people you come in contact with, your drive and ambition. Everything comes
from God. Christians should possess a humbleness and appreciation for everything
they have and not set their sights on selfish motives.


## Part 3: The Mindset We Should Have Toward Work

Part 3 is all about mindset. This is where the book became really valuable to me
personally. I'm a big believer in power of mindset. I feel the mindset you have
controls your actions, your thoughts, your success, and your happiness. If you
want to change your views on life, control stress, run a marathon, start a
company, it all comes down to your mindset.

Whether you realize it or not, you have a mindset. If you don't take away
anything else from this blog post, I really hope you spend the time examining
your mindset. Not just regarding work, but your mindset towards life. Here,
we'll just talk about work, but mindset controls everything you do.

So, what should our mindset be to have meaningful, productive, and rewarding
work?

Your World View


Need for a Mindset


* We all have a "worldview" which shapes our lives.
* Do great work to glorify God.
* Always honor God in your work.
* Respect others - all are made in the image of God.
* Having things won't make us any happier. Doing good for others 
* We should rest, respect the Sabbath. It reminds us of our true dependence on
  God.
* Intgrate faith and work. You must be the same person at work that you are at
  Church. 


### Mindset

* Respect everyone
* Be grateful for your job
* Work to glorify God, for the work itself, not for yourself.
* Work is a "calling", not a vocation.

### Christian Beliefs

* Our place in heaven, with God, is secured thru the death of Jesus. By grace,
  we have been saved. Our battle has been won. We can work in humble confidence
  knowing that God will provide.

* Christians don't take jobs for the money, rather for the work itself. We will
  accept less money to work on something that glorifies God or helps others.

## Why do *you* work?

### Identity

Work is an increasingly important facet of our lives. Work is a source of
income, yes, but to many people, work is their identity. It's *who they are*. 

Despite, or perhaps because of, all the technology we have, it seems people are
working technology would allow us to *reduce* the amount of time we spend
working by harder, longer than ever before. Early technologists and philosophers
believed making us more produtive and simplifying our lives. 

Yet we spend more time today working than ever before. We login at night, on the
weekends, and have constant contact with work. We are increasingly having to put
up boundaries and create "work/life balance" for ourselves.

Why?

In today's world, work is a source of pride, accomplishment, status,
self-esteem, and ego. People pride themselves on how much they work, how busy
they are, how many projects they do, how good they are at their jobs, and how
great their company is. 

As the world becomes more connected, competition becomes more fierce, companies
and people are being driven to work longer, harder, and produce more than every
before. 

Where does it end? Will there ever be a work/life balance? Why is work so
important to so many, to the point it is controlling their lives? Why are our
social media feeds flooded with people self-promoting themselves and the work
they do?

A huge percentage of our waking lives is spent working. Chances are good you'll
send more time with your coworkers many weeks than you will with your family. It
is wise, then, to reflect on the work you do and the long term goals you have
for work.


## Key Ideas

### Job vs. Calling

All jobs are important. Treat everyone with respect. If you treat everyone with
respect, you can talk with the CEO as easily as the janitor. 

The most valuable thing I took away from this book is the mindset and world view
perspective associated with how to view work. 


### Work Under the Work






### Money

If you ask the average American (or other nationalities as well) why they work,
you'll certainly hear the word "money". We need money to survive.



### Work for pride

* Self-image, source of identity, fuels our ego and sets our self-esteem.
* America values *self* more than others.
  * Taught early 
    * "You can do anything you put your mind to".
    * "Your Dad worked extremely hard to get us to where we are today."
* Hard to distinguish what you do - need to advertise and self-promote on
  LinkedIn. Work is not visible - like building decks or cutting grass.


### Work for fulfullment

* There is a *joy* about doing great work, accomplishing something. It help us
  thrive mentally.
* There is a pride for a "job well done" - to be recognized by your company or
  peers.

### Work to keep up

* Society respects and values hard work. To "fit in", you're expected to embrace
  the "hustle", "grind", "persevere" cultural norms. If you don't, someone else
  will.

### Work to help others.

* The most meaningful work is what you do for others.
* Volunteering, but also in the day-to-day.


### Work / Life Balance

Railing against overworking is not new. People have been struggling and pushing
back against workaholic cultures. Employees are looking for cultures that
encourage work life balance.

## Does balancing work make you soft?

* If you set goals and focus (work smart), you can beat others who are working
  more.
* It's about putting work into perspective, not making it an idol which becomes
  your identity and ruins your life.
