## "I Have to Work"

I have struggled with work for almost 20 years. 

I graduated college in 1999 with two things: a Bachelor of Science from the
University of Minnesota and a hunger to succeed. For me, at 22, success
meant one thing: money. I have always loved computer science, engineering, and
math. But when looking for jobs, I wasn't nearly as concerned about working on
meaningful problems or hard engineering as I was about making money.

Work is an extremely, increasingly, important facet of our lives. Despite, or
perhaps because of, all the technology we have, it seems people are working
harder than ever before. Technology was supposed to help us *reduce* the amount
of time we spend working by making us more produtive, simplifying our lives. 

Yet we spend more time today working than ever before. We login at night, on the
weekends, and have constant contact with work. We are increasingly having to put
up boundaries and create "work/life balance" for ourselves.

Why?

In today's world, work is a source of pride, accomplishment, status,
self-esteem, and ego. People pride themselves on how much they work, how busy
they are, how many projects they do, how good they are at their jobs, and how
great their company is. 

As the world becomes more connected, competition becomes more fierce, companies
and people are being driven to work longer, harder, and produce more than every
before. 

Where does it end? Will there ever be a work/life balance? Why is work so
important to so many, to the point it is controlling their lives? Why are our
social media feeds flooded with people self-promoting themselves and the work
they do?

A huge percentage of our waking lives is spent working. Chances are good you'll
send more time with your coworkers many weeks than you will with your family. It
is wise, then, to reflect on the work you do and the long term goals you have
for work.

For me, Every Good Endeavor puts work into perspective. It's easy for me to get
wrapped up in work. 

The book is divided into three parts:

1. God's plan for work.
1. Our problems with work.
1. The Gospel and work.


## Why do we work?


Why?

Work was created by God. God himself worked. He created the heavens and earth,
man and woman, all creation. As long as man has existed, there has been work. Adam and Eve
were responsible for working the Garden of Eden. And ever since, until today,
we work. 


## Job vs. Calling

All jobs are important. Treat everyone with respect. If you treat everyone with
respect, you can talk with the CEO as easily as the janitor.
