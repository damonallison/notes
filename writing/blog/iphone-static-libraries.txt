Static Library:

 1. Create the library source code.

 2. Remove the existing target from the library project.
 
 3. Add a new Cocoa Touch -> Static Library target.

 4. Remove all the unnecessary files (resources, main.m, etc), build
    the target.


Library Client:

 1. Add the library's .xcodeproj library as a file in the project.
    Right click project -> Add -> Existing files -> lib.xcodeproj
    (Don't copy local - not sure what would happen here).

 2. Add the corelib project as a target dependency.  
    Right Click Target -> Get Info -> Direct Dependencies

 3. Make sure the static library is added to your target's "Link
    Binary With Libraries".

 3. Update header search path for all builds to point at the lib.
    $(SRCROOT)/../CoreLib/ 

    Project -> Get Info -> Build -> search for "header search"

 4. #include the headers from the static lib.
