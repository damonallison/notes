JS was submitted to ECMA and because of trademark issues was named EcmaScript (ES). ES3 and 5 are available, 4 was not released.

JS is case sensitive. HTML is not. JS uses lowercase names (onclick) HTML van use anything (onClick)

Weird OO (constructors).
Liberal implicit type conversion (opposite of go).
All numbers are 64 bit floats.

JavaScript does not do string normalization. Unicode defines a standard normalization procedure. What is it?
