# Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, openly visible ledger.

## Blockchain in logistics

Communication and information visibility is inherently slow when multiple
parties are involved in a transaction. In logistics, particularly ocean
shipments, multiple parties are involved. Each party must exchange various
information, coordinate timing, protocols, and data structures.

A decentralized, distributed store provides:

* Common data store, data structure.
* Common eventing and rules (chaincode / "smart contracts") which *all* parties
  must abide by.
* Reduced lines of communication. Each party in a TX only needs to communicate
  with the blockchain, not multiple 3rd parties.
