# Mobile

## To Research

* iOS libraries
* Android architecture components
* Research team
* Final sales pitch / outcome thinking

## Designs / Patterns

* Thin client.
    * All check in / stop logic pushed to server.
    * Keep monitoring for region boundaries / device state changes.

* Flux (Unidirectional data flow) :: Predictable data
    * Moving from MVVM to Flux.
    * MVC does not scale. Cyclic pattern emerge between views / models. Hard to reason about.
    * UI only needs to render the given state.
    * Easy to reason about / Debuggable / enables unit testing.

```
Action -> Dispatcher -> Store (Data Layer) -> View
                ^                                 |
                |                                 |

* [MVC vs. MVP vs. MVVM on Android](https://academy.realm.io/posts/eric-maxwell-mvc-mvp-and-mvvm-on-android/)

* MVC (iOS)
    * Model is dumb.
    * View is dumb - knows nothing about the model.
    * Controller coordinates everything - becoming an extension of the view.

* MVP
    * Model is dumb (same as MVC).
    * View (Activity) creates a presenter.
    * Presenter calls back into the view to set itself up.

* MVVM
    * Model is dumb (same as MVC).
    * View data binds to the VM.
    * VM provides observables the view listens to. Same as MVP, but no knowledge of views.

* MVP is linear View <--> Presenter <--> Model

* MVVM
    * View creates presenter.
    * Action happens on view, calls into presenter.
    * Presenter sets state on view, passing view the ViewModel.

    * View ---> Presenter
       ^             |
       ------VM-------

## iOS

* GCD
    * Dispatch queues

* Core Data
    * Graph persistence.
    * `NSManagedObject` `NSFetchRequest`, `NSManagedObjectModel`, `NSManagedObjectContext`
    * `NSManagedObjectContext` == queue bound concurrency.

* CoreLocation
    * CL / GPS / Region / BLE Region monitoring (iBeacon).

* CoreBluetooth
    * Scan for peripherials, read / write characteristics (data) over BT. (readValueForCharacteristic)
    * Subscribe with [p setNofifyValue:YES forCharacteristic:c]

* Push Notifications
    * Request auth (device token)
    * Ability to add custom actions to each notification category.
    * Handle `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:`

* Backgrounding / Lifecycle
    * Active -> Backgrounded -> Suspended -> Killed
    * All UI on main thread. All UIKit objects are descendant of `UIApplication`, which is executing on main.

 * UI
    * Auto layout - constraint based layout.
    * Size classes - allow you to vary the layout based on `traits` - horizontal and vertical dimensions.
    * UIKit

* Realm
    * **Would move to Firebase if starting new.**
    * Simple ORM w/ simple threading model.
    * Reactive. Queries updated in realtime.
    * Realm sync for cross-device persistence (use Firebase instead?)
    * Queries are lazy.


## Android

* MVP Pattern w/ ViewModels as model tailored for the view.

* [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) : DI
* [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary)
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) : HTTP -> Java (OKHttp)
* [Realm](https://realm.io/products/realm-database/)
* [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) : field / method binding
* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
* [Volley](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html) : HTTP
