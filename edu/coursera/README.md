# Continuing Education Research

Learning is lifelong. This repository keeps all my notes I've taken during various classes, lectures, books, important meetings, videos, etc.

Most of my notes center around data science and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the first real algorithmic and complex problem domain I've seen in my career. Everything else, to this point, has been trivial in comparison.

* 1990's : Windows Development
* 2000's : Web Development
* 2010's : Mobile Development / Cloud Development
* 2020's : Artificial Intelligence

## Why

Why study data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?

* AI is the obvious next frontier within engineering.
* Trends over last 20 years : web, mobile, cloud, intelligence.
* The problems are challenging and difficult. They are academic and foundational computer science problems.
* Hard problems attract smart people, smart tooling.

## Goals

* Work on algorithmically challenging, interesting projects with the latest computer science tooling.
* Respectable, recognizable certification or degree.
* All coursework transferable to a higher degree.
* Grow my personal network with data science engineers.

## Strategy

* Meet people. Use this research to rekindle existing relationships and grow new relationships.
* Use C.H. Robinson to grow. There is a lot of opportunity to work with data science teams / projects within C.H.
* Coursework. Work with an online program with transferable credits to a more advanced degree (i.e., masters degree)

## Approach

* Start small, free, in data science (hadoop, spark, statistics). Learn the tooling and concepts.
* Work into the industry.
* Advance into machine learning and more advanced AI. Tools and infrastructure is easy, algorithms are hard.
