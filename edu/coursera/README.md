# Continuing Education Research

Learning is lifelong. This repository keeps all my notes I've taken during various classes, lectures, books, important meetings, videos, etc.

Most of my notes center around data science and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is the first real algorithmic and complex problem domain I've seen in my career. Everything else, to this point, has been trivial in comparison.

* 1990's : Windows Development
* 2000's : Web Development
* 2010's : Mobile Development / Cloud Development
* 2020's : Artificial Intelligence

## Why

Why study data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?

* AI is the obvious next frontier within engineering.
* Trends over last 20 years : web, mobile, cloud, intelligence.
* The problems are challenging and difficult. They are academic and foundational computer science problems.
* Hard problems attract smart people, smart tooling.

## Goals

* Work on algorithmically challenging, interesting projects with the latest computer science tooling.
* Respectable, recognizable certification or degree.
* All coursework transferable to a higher degree.
* Grow my personal network with data science engineers.

## Strategy

* Meet people. Use this research to rekindle existing relationships and grow new relationships.
* Use C.H. Robinson to grow. There is a lot of opportunity to work with data science teams / projects within C.H.
* Coursework. Work with an online program with transferable credits to a more advanced degree (i.e., masters degree)

## Approach

* Start small, free, in data science (hadoop, spark, statistics). Learn the tooling and concepts.
* Work into the industry.
* Advance into machine learning and more advanced AI. Tools and infrastructure is easy, algorithms are hard.

## Degree Research

### Criteria

* Quality. Teaches the foundations of statistics, algorithms, and machine learning.
* Online. No time or desire to travel or meet in person. Online meetings (Hangouts) acceptable.
* Expandable. Any work done for a "certification" or lower degree can be applied toward a more advanced degree.
* Inexpensive. Reimbursable via tuition reimbursement or cheap enough to fit within a monthly budget.
* Flexible. Cannot commit to a rigorous, 20hr / week schedule.

### Udacity

Udacity's curriculum is tailored for vocational training. It wasn't designed by
academics, rather industry professionals. They have "Nanodegree" programs - 4
month ($400/month) programs.

The curriculum was designed by industry partners, so they use IBM Watson tools,
work on solving problems with Starbucks data, etc.

They used to be $200/month and offer tech masters degrees thru Udacity. They now
cost $400/month and do not offer masters programs.

### Coursera

Coursera partners with colleges to offer courses and degrees. They have a *lot*
of full accredited masters degree programs.

* Thru coursera.
* Tuition under $20k.
* 2-3 year commitment.

#### U.of Michigan: Master Of Applied Data Science

* 12 month curriculum
* $32-42k

34 small courses, each about 4 weeks.


#### U. of Illinois: Master of Computer Science in Data Science

Can start with open courses and transfer them to degree courses.

* $21k, 1-3 years, 8 courses

* Don't like the focus on cloud computing.

* ML
  * "Tool oriented and problem-directed" approaches to ML w/ vision, NLP,
    geopositioning, voice & music.
* Data mining
* Data visualization
* Cloud computing

#### U.of Colorado Boulder: Master of Science in Data Science

New in 2021. No application. You must enroll / pass 3 1 credit "pathway" courses.

30 short courses, about 2 years to complete.

### edX
