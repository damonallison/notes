# Degree Research

## Goals

* Masters of Science in Data Science or Artificial Intelligence
* Fully online
* $15k or less
* 10-15 hours a week / 1-2 years


## Coursera

Coursera partners with colleges to offer courses and degrees. They have a *lot*
of full accredited masters degree programs.

* Thru coursera.
* Tuition under $20k.
* 2-3 year commitment.

### U. of Illinois: Master of Computer Science in Data Science

Can start with open courses and transfer them to degree courses.

* $21k, 1-3 years, 8 courses

* This is not really "data science" focused. There are no probability or
  statistics courses in the core curriculum, for example. Feels more engineering
  focused that data science focused.

#### Curriculum

* Machine Learning
  * CS498: Applied Machine Learning
* Data Mining
* Data visualization
* Cloud computing

### edX

#### University of Texas: Master's Degree in Data Science

Foundational statistical theory.

Prerequisites:

  * Multivariable Calculus - MATH 408D
  * Linear Algebra - MATH 341

* Statistics (College level intro to stats)
  * Introduction to Statistics (eg. SDS 302, 304, 306 or equivalent)
  * Biostatistics (eg. SDS 328M or equivalent)

* $10k, 10 courses, 1.5-3 yeaars

Combination of Statistics and Data Sciences and Department of Computer Science.

10 courses. 3 foundational

This is a 30 hour program (3 credit hours per course). There are 3 core required courses and 7 additional required courses for a total of 10 courses. The core requirement will be satisfied with three foundational courses which will provide students with a broad, foundational understanding of the field and will also establish the basis for some of the prescribed electives. They include:

* DSC 381: Probability and Simulation Based Inference for Data Science
* DSC 382: Foundations of Regression and Predictive Modeling
* DSC 388G: Algorithms: Techniques and Theory

Non-core requirements include the following courses:

* DSC 383: Advanced Predictive Models for Complex Data
  * Pre-requisite of DSC 382
* DSC 384: Design Principles and Causal Inference for Data-Based Decision Making
  * No Pre-requisite
* DSC 385: Data Exploration, Visualization, and Foundations of Unsupervised Learning
  * No Prerequisite
* DSC 91L: Principles of Machine Learning
  * Pre-requisite of DSC 382
* DSC 395T: Advanced Linear Algebra for Computation
  * No Prerequisite
* DSC 395T: Optimization
  * Pre-requisite of DSC 388G
* DSC 395T: Deep Learning
  * Pre-requisite of DSC 382
