# Machine Learning

## Week 1

ML: Getting computers to learn without being explictly programmed.

There are categories of problems that can't be directly programmed:

* Flying a a helicopter
* Handwriting recognition
* Image recognition

### Types of Machine Learning

* Supervised / Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcment learning / recommender systems ()

Equally / more important as ML itself is determining how to apply ML in the real
world.

### Supervised Learning

Building a model with labeled (actual) data.

* Regression: Trying to predict a continuous valued output. (Price of a house, temperature)
* Classification: Trying to predict a discrete value output (rain, sun, snow)

* Support Vector Machines: Allow a computer to deal with an infinite number of features


### Unsupervised Learning

Building a model which learns the structure of data without labeled data.

Clustering is unsupervised. Clusters are learned from the data.

Examples (clustering):

* Google News: Clustering news stories together
* Facebook friends: who are related?
* Market segmentation: what groups of customers will buy a new product?
* Gene: group genes that are related by different variables: age, lifespan,
  location, roles, etc.

Examples (cocktail party):

* Separate out multiple audio sources (english vs. spanish, speech vs. music)

Octave (or matlab). High level environment used for prototyping. The right
environment makes implementing algorithms faster (higher level environment).
