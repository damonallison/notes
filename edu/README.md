  they are involved in many teams.

* Introduces graph data models, and properties of graphs (distance, etc)
* Discusses streaming data (windowing, )
* Management systems
  * Data lakes - no structure, all streams flow as-is into the lake.
  * Relational DBMS vs. Unstructured (Mongo)
  * Redis as a K/V store

#### 07/2017: Intro to Big Data

* Introduction to the exponentially growing data landscape.
* The characteristics of data (volume, variety, veracity (quality), valence
  (connectedness),
* Introduces the high level process of data science:
  * Acquire -> Prepare -> Analyze -> Report -> Act
* Introduces BDMSs and Hadoop / HDFS, Yarn, MapReduce

## MOOC Research

### Udacity Nanodegrees

Here is the recommended order for taking Udacity courses:

* AI Programming with Python (pre-reqs)
* Data Science Nanodegree (overlaps w/ ML) *or* the ML Nanodegree
  * The DS nanodegree has a weak term 2, bit the DS curriculum is still strong.
* AI

#### AI Programming with Python (Beginner)

AI programming with python includes learning about python, common DS libraries
(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch) as well as foundational math - linear
algebra and calculus.

Labeled as beginner, but still pretty advanced.

* 3 month program - $599

* Foundational math and python skills and libraries for programming AI.
* You will use a pre-built neural network and also build an image classifier.
* Python Basics
	* Anaconda
	* Jupyter Notebooks
	* Numpy - manipulate data for ML
	* Pandas - load and process data for ML problems
	* Matplotlib
* Linear Algebra Essentials
	* Vectors
	* Linear transformations and matrices
	* Linear Algebra in Neural Networks
* Calculus Essentials
	* Derivatives - why are they important to ML?


#### Data Science Nanodegree Program

This class is much more technical and engineering based - more advanced than the
Data Engineering Nanodegree.

7 months total over 2 terms. ($2000)

This is an ideal transition from engineer into data scientist. This is a
difficult program. It also has a great two term setup - the first term is ML
algorithms, the second term is applied ML - tools and languages that you'll use
in the real world.

Optional texts:
  * Elements of Statistical Learning
  * Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective
  * Python Machine Learning

It expects that you understand:

* Programming
  * Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas

* Probability / Statistics
  * Descriptive statistics - estimating distribution, center, spread.
  * Inferential statistics - sampling statistics, hypothesis testing.
  * Probability - theory, conditional probability.

* Math
  * Linear Algebra (matrix manipulation, multiplication)
  * Calculus (maximizing and minimizing algebraic equations), data cleaning with
    SkLearn and Pandas.

* Visualization with matplotlib

* Goals
  * Use Python and SQL to analyze data from different sources.
  * Use statistics and probability to design and execute A/B tests and
    recommendation engines to make data driven decisions.
  * Build / tune ML models, compare model performance (accuracy).
  * Deploy DS solutions using a basic flask app.
  * Manipulate / analyze data at scale using Spark.

data. It's not about analysis or algorithms to process the data.

* 110 hours, 5 months
* Course 1: Data Modeling - Document & Relational DBs (OLAP vs. OLTP)
* Course 2: Cloud Data Warehouses - running data in AWS
* Course 3: Data Lakes w/ Spark

#### Machine Learning Engineer

This program will teach you how to become a Machine Learning Engineer, build
Machine Learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance,
healthcare, education, and more

The program is divided into two terms of 3 months each. We expect students to work
10 hours/week on average. Estimated time commitment to complete both terms is
200 hours.
