# Education

## Goal

Fundamentally strong ML scientist and engineer.

## MOOC Research

### Udacity Nanodegrees

Here is the recommended order for taking Udacity courses:

* AI Programming with Python (pre-reqs)
* Data Science Nanodegree (overlaps w/ ML) *or* the ML Nanodegree
  * The DS nanodegree has a weak term 2, bit the DS curriculum is still strong.
* AI

#### AI Programming with Python (Beginner)

AI programming with python includes learning about python, common DS libraries
(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch) as well as foundational math - linear
algebra and calculus.

Labeled as beginner, but still pretty advanced.

* 3 month program - $599

* Foundational math and python skills and libraries for programming AI.
* You will use a pre-built neural network and also build an image classifier.
* Python Basics
	* Anaconda
	* Jupyter Notebooks
	* Numpy - manipulate data for ML
	* Pandas - load and process data for ML problems
	* Matplotlib
* Linear Algebra Essentials
	* Vectors
	* Linear transformations and matrices
	* Linear Algebra in Neural Networks
* Calculus Essentials
	* Derivatives - why are they important to ML?


#### Data Science Nanodegree Program

This class is much more technical and engineering based - more advanced than the
Data Engineering Nanodegree.

7 months total over 2 terms. ($2000)

This is an ideal transition from engineer into data scientist. This is a
difficult program. It also has a great two term setup - the first term is ML
algorithms, the second term is applied ML - tools and languages that you'll use
in the real world.

Optional texts:
  * Elements of Statistical Learning
  * Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective
  * Python Machine Learning

It expects that you understand:

* Programming
  * Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas

* Probability / Statistics
  * Descriptive statistics - estimating distribution, center, spread.
  * Inferential statistics - sampling statistics, hypothesis testing.
  * Probability - theory, conditional probability.

* Math
  * Linear Algebra (matrix manipulation, multiplication)
  * Calculus (maximizing and minimizing algebraic equations), data cleaning with
    SkLearn and Pandas.

* Visualization with matplotlib

* Goals
  * Use Python and SQL to analyze data from different sources.
  * Use statistics and probability to design and execute A/B tests and
    recommendation engines to make data driven decisions.
  * Build / tune ML models, compare model performance (accuracy).
  * Deploy DS solutions using a basic flask app.
  * Manipulate / analyze data at scale using Spark.

Term 1: ML for Data Scientists

  * SMART goals
* Capstone project


#### Data Engineering Nanodegree Program

One 5 month term. Estimated salary $74-110k

The focus of this class is working with databases, data sets, and data movement
(pipelines). This class is more about collecting (ETL), storing, and moving
data. It's not about analysis or algorithms to process the data.

* 110 hours, 5 months
* Course 1: Data Modeling - Document & Relational DBs (OLAP vs. OLTP)
* Course 2: Cloud Data Warehouses - running data in AWS
* Course 3: Data Lakes w/ Spark
* Course 4: Automate Data Pipelines (Apache Airflow)


#### Machine Learning Engineer

This program will teach you how to become a Machine Learning Engineer, build
Machine Learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance,
healthcare, education, and more

The program is divided into two terms of 3 months each. We expect students to work
10 hours/week on average. Estimated time commitment to complete both terms is
200 hours.

Prereqs: Python, knowledge of inferential statistics, probability, linear
algebra and calculus.

Term 1:

* Model Evaluation and Building
  * Understand model metrics.
  * Load data w/ Pandas, train / test models w/ Scikit-learn.

* Supervised learning
  * Linear Regression vs. Classification.
  * Neural networks, decision trees, naive bayes
  * Support vector machine
  * Ensemble of learners

* Unsupervised learning
  * Clustering
  * Feature scaling, dimensionality reduction

Term 2:

* Deep learning
  * Neural networks
* Reinforcement learning
  * CNNs

#### AI Nanodegree

A really advanced program.

Suggests AI Programming with Python, Machine Learning Engineer, Deep Learning Nanodegrees as prerequisites.

* Follows AIMA from Norvig / Russell

Projects
* Sudoku - Solver
	* Uses constraint propagation and backtracking to only consider reasonable solution candidates and efficiently solves any sudoku puzzle.
* Forward planning agent
* Adversarial game playing agent
* Speech Tagging
