# Education

## Goals

* Strong understanding machine learning, AI, and deep learning.

## Questions

* What are the primary tools in the DS toolkit?
  * Relational DB preferences?

## TODO

### Languages

* Python
* SQL

### Libraries

* Pandas
* Sklearn
* matplotlib

### Tools

* PostreSQL
* NoSQL : Mongo and/or Cassandra
* Spark
  * When to use it, when not to use it?
  * Spark WebUI
* Apache Airflow
  * How to build data pipelines?

### Math

* Linear Algebra (matrix multiplication, manipulation)
* Calculus (maximizing and minimizing algebraic equations)
* OLAP vs. OLTP
* Statistics

* Relational DB Modeling
  * Schema fundamentals - normalization and denormalized schemas (STAR and
    Snowflake)
  * Indexing
  * Create OLAP cubes - Fact & Dimension tables

* Document DB Modeling
  * Primary key selection, clustering column selection.
  * Mongo, Cassandra


## Programs

### Udacity

##### Data Engineering Nanodegree Program

One 5 month term. Estimated salary $74-110k

The focus of this class is working with databases, data sets, and data movement
(pipelines). This class is more about collecting (ETL), storing, and moving
data. It's not about analysis or algorithms to process the data.

* 110 hours, 5 months
* Course 1: Data Modeling - Document & Relational DBs (OLAP vs. OLTP)
* Course 2: Cloud Data Warehouses - running data in AWS
* Course 3: Data Lakes w/ Spark
* Course 4: Automate Data Pipelines (Apache Airflow)

#### Data Science Nanodegree Program

This class is much more technical and engineering based - more advanced than the
Data Engineering Nanodegree. 7 months total over 2 terms. ($2000)

This is an ideal transition from engineer into data scientist. This is a
difficult program. It also has a great two term setup - the first term is ML
algorithms, the second term is applied ML - tools and languages that you'll use
in the real world.

Optional texts:
  * Elements of Statistical Learning
  * Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective
  * Python Machine Learning

It expects that you understand:

* Programming
  * Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas

* Probability / Statistics
  * Descriptive statistics - estimating distribution, center, spread.
  * Inferential statistics - sampling statistics, hypothesis testing.
  * Probability - theory, conditional probability.

* Math
  * Linear Algebra (matrix manipulation, multiplication)
  * Calculus (maximizing and minimizing algebraic equations), data cleaning with
    SkLearn and Pandas.

* Visualization with matplotlib

* Goals
  * Use Python and SQL to analycs data from different sources.
  * Use statistics and probability to design and execute A/B tests and
    recommendation engines to make data driven decisions.
  * Build / tune ML models, compare model performance (accuracy).
  * Deploy DS solutions using a basic flask app.
  * Manipulate / analyze data at scale using Spark.

#### AI Programming With Python

AI programming with python includes learning about python, common DS libraries
(NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch) as well as foundational math - linear
algebra and calculus.

* Intro to Python
* Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Anaconda, Pandas, Matplotlib
* Linear Algebra
* Calculus Essentials
* Neural Networks: NNs, deep learning, and PyTorch
