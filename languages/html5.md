# HTML

What's "new" in JS for HTML5?
  * geolocation
  * storage capabilities : "localStorage" "sessionStorage" "indexedDB" "webSQL"
  * Filesystem API (client side virtual file system?)
  * FileReader API : allows JS to read files being inserted via <input type="file"> (e.g., image editor)
  * Better control over the back/forward buttons.
  * Better drag and drop API.
  * "Web Workers" : background threads.
  * "Web Sockets" : full duplex socket connection.

What's *next* for HTML?
  * Peer-to-peer (PeerConnection API) and WebRTC.
  * Web Intents
  * Mobile HW APIs.

"But letâ€™s be honest: now HTML5 is basically an umbrella for everything, and thus it actually means nothing." - Kyle Simpson - JavaScript and HTML5 Now
