## 601 : Apple Platforms Kickoff ##

This is the developer overview for *all* the changes being introduced by Apple.
Covers Lion / iOS / iCloud technical overviews. A really solid overview, I would
start here after the keynote.

Craig Fredighiri

* SSL Transport is part of iOS 5

* Simplification by taking things away (scroll bars, gestures)

Versioning :

        Delta based versioning : use NSDocument.

Full Screen :

        Use NSToolbar (so it slides down in full screen mode when user shows
        menu bar.

        Toolbar / Sidebar : AccessoryView (new API) controls that tuck away in
        full screen, but are accessible on demand.

        Javascript API's for going full screen in web apps.

GLKit :

        Bringing UIKit and OpenGL a bit closer by wrapping some of the
        boilerplate code into libraries.


Performance :

        Multi-threaded is hard. GCD was introduced in snow leopard. GCD improved
        to background I/O and manage async network I/O.

        Accelerator : takes advantage of vector units in CPU. Full Accelerate into iOS.

Instruments:

        Systrace
        Retain cycle debugging (better leak detection).

Powerbox :

        System process : allows processes to break out of app sandbox for
        user-allowed file access.

Lion / App Sandboxing: Entitlements in XCode 4.1:

        Entitlements : permission set allowed for the application.
        6 months after Lion release : all entitlements must be justified.

File Vault 2:

        Encrypts entire drive (CoreStorage based). You cannot boot your mac
        without pwd entered (pre-boot). (AES-XTS - processor level makes data
        protection fast / painless)


iCloud :

        Key-value store : all data available to all devices regarless if your
        application is running.

        File : transfers are async. Metadata moves to all devices. Data itself
        moves later or just when needed.

        Files are "LAN aware" - can update files if on the same LAN.

        Geolocation based - stored closest to user.

        URL for user sharing.

        Request entitlements to iCloud. UIDocument (NSDocument) has built in support for cloud basing

        NSFileManager / NSFilePresenter / NSFileCoordinator

        Core Data DB can automatically sync via iCloud storage (Core Data).

Sharing data between different apps (different bundle IDs)

        Apps must be from the same company, but multiple apps can share data.


Auto Layout:

        Dynamically resizing UI based on the locale / dynamic resizing of UI
        controls based on contents.


## 300 : Developer Tools Kickoff ##

Overview of all the new features in the tools set. This provides an overview for
all other tools focused talks this week. Worth the time to watch.


LLVM Compiler 2 (integrated into XCode - allowed XCode to provide "fix it").

Assembly / preprocessing output.

Auto Layout :

        Springs / struts : auto resizing. Constraints : aligning / sizing.
        (Flexible / fixed positioning / centering constraints)

Xcode 4.1 Behaviors :

        Custom actions that happen on system events (fixed set of options for
        each behaviors - you can add a custom scripts).

Xcode 4.2 (iOS 5):

        Data sync : unit tests can upload data to devices pre-launch.
        Instruments : system trace for iOS.
        Networking activity.
        Simulate Locations
        Record paths of locations.
        Storyboarding : Jon Hess : Scenes (VC's) & Segues.

OpenGL :

        OpenGL ES Performance Detector / Open GL Analyzer Instrument

        OpenGL ES Debugger : IDE Integrated. "Markers" : allows you to annotate
        game elements within a frame to improve pinpointing debugging drawing.

LLVM / LLDB :

        LLDB : GDB replacement.

        LLVM : v3 coming in iOS 5. Xcode 4.2 does not have GCC (does have
        LLVM-GCC for compatibility).

Memory Management:

        LLVM 3 : Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Compiler automatically synthesizing retain/release.

        "Memory Management built into the language" : @autoreleasepool { }
        Retain cycles : (circular references) : zeroing weak references.

        Instruments : automatically displays retain cycles.
        Retain/release 60% faster w/ ARC.
        ARC : immediately removed from memory when they are not reachable (not the top of the runloop).


## 400 : Media / Gaming ##

Overview of the media / gaming changes in iOS. The gaming portion was really
high level - they demoed some production games to say "see, we can do better
textures because the GPUs are awesome". Didn't show code.

Don't watch this one unless you deal with media streaming / Airplay.


GLKit

        Bridges UIKit -> Open GL.

Airplay :

        Improved for wifi.
## 200 : Core OS Networking, Key Principles ##

Watch it.

"Captive Network"

        "Walled Garden" for wi-fi hotspots (starbucks).
        Supports WISPr and other auth methods.
        OS detects and remembers captive networks.
        Support now in lion.

SSL VPN (iOS 4.0)

New Enhancements :

        IGMPv3 (multicast group management protocol) - games, etc.
        PF : IPFW no longer being enhanced / supported by community (PF is the future).
        Traffic Throttling : background processes on IOS5 / low priority traffic
        on lion. (time machine backup)

        Scoped interfaces (DNS, routing, proxies) : better infrastructure to present the user with login/pass entry screen.

        Back to my MAC : ISP's put into a lot of NAT's into place.

Tools

        nettop : network "top"

        "network link conditioner" : (lion) simulates "real-world" network
        connection (delays, disconnects, etc).

        Remote packet capture for iOS : allows you to connect iOS device to
        lion, allows you to record iOS network traffic.


Networking Key Principles

        "Write to the highest API level as you can" : allows you to future proof
        your app.

        Darwin -> CFNetwork -> Foundation (Write to CFNetwork an above).

        Do not depend on transport level details (wifi / 3G) that may change -
        bus may look like wifi - but the wifi is backed by 3G. (layered network)

        Don't assume the network is free (don't abuse the connection) : power is
        not free either. (3G radio is not cheap).

        Bonjour / funcation APIs using RnuLoop event sources).

        Use TLS wherever possible.

        Firesheep (firefox networking sniffer - pull cookies, etc)

        Get ready for IPv6. Assume you could get multiple DNS lookups (v4 & v6),
        etc..

        Use Bonjour (sleep proxy : still allows machine to go asleep, tells
        other devices what capabilities are available even when the machine is
        sleeping).

        Reachability API : use it.

## 501 : iCloud Storage Overview ##

Really high level iCloud stuff. Mostly background / rehash of what was already
said. Skip this, read the iCloud documentation instead.

* NSMetadata[Query|Item] : percentage complete / conflicts / more "cloud metadata" stuff...


UIDocument :

		async read/write.
		auto-save.
		iCloud integration.

NSFileManager

        New APIs for reading / writing to iCloud (ubiquitous url) and moving
        files between local / ubiquity.

NSDocument :

		Sits on top of NSFileCoordinator.
		NSFilePresenter (manaage concurrent access to document).
		iCloud supports Core Data (shoebox app : SQLite + files (iPhoto)).

MSMetadataQuery :

        File search.

iCloud : key/value

		NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore : separate app-based quota (64k).
		Last change wins (no conflicts).

        Write all user files to a "Documents" directory - contents are made
        visible to the user. Everything outside of Documents is grouped together
        and treated as a unit the user can keep / delete.  (what is the UI?)

## 306 : Maximizing Productivity in Xcode4 ##

Skip this session.



* Intro session - basic navigation / Xcode 4 panels / and navigating through
  code. Mostly entry level info - just go through the docs / Xcode4 menu
  navigation system.


* Open Quickly:lineNumber : adding a line number will bring you to the LOC you
  mention.

## 307 : Moving the The Apple LLVM Compiler ##

Not a bad session, but mostly a comparison to GCC and can mostly be summed up
with this : just use LLVM 3.0.

If you are interested in C++0x - watch the 2nd 1/2 of this session. If not, just
skip this section.


Clang front end : much more clear in errors
-Wconditional-uninitialized : aggressively

Type inferencing detects type mismatch.

		NSSet *numbers = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@"one", @"two", nil];

* Better output from the compiler to enhance Xcode's "fix-it" functionality.

Static Analyzer:

		Build Options -> Run Static Analyzer == YES

libc++: LLCM C++ Standard Library

		New C++ standard library. Support for C++0x.
		Better data structures (faster) than libstdc++)
		Regex, smart pointers, hash tables
		http://libcxx.llvm.org

Compiler Performance

		LLVM 2-3x faster build times than GCC
		Optimization : 10-20% faster resulting code.

Transition Tips

		Xcode 4.1 :: LLVM Compiler 2.1 (bug fix release)
		Xcode 4.2 :: LLVM Compiler 3.0 ()

## 205 : Core OS Networking In-Depth ##

Must watch if you deal with networking at all. Introduces some cool network
related tools : nettop (monitor) / network link conditioner (throttler) / rvictl
(capture off iOS device).


IPv6 Addresses

		IPV4 : 32bit
		IPv6 : 64bit network id | 64 bits interface id

		2001:db8:0:7

		IPv6 does not fragment packets due to different MTUs.
		Your address is public, but gets renumbered more frequently.

		If you still have IPv4, you still have to do NAT.

tunnelbroker.net

		For setting your home network to use IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel.

Darwin Network Changes

		Throttling (iCloud)
		TCP buffer sizing

Address Selection

		Same API : getaddrinfo() : does DNS query for v4 and v6 - tries to find the best address. Looks into routing stats - if round trip is
        faster, use it.

		CFSocketStream (Same API) : handles finding the best connection (tries multiple simultaneously). Connect by name / not address. Let CF
        handle the address resulution.

		NSURLConnection / CFHTTPStream all based on CFSocketStream.


Network Statistics

		nettop : connection diagnostics

Background Network Throttling

		Send side : Packet loss / round trip times determine when to throttle.

Take Away

		Network apps : UIRequiresPersistentWifi ()

Tools (2)

		Network Link Conditioner (NLC) : emulate network conditions (presets for edge, 3g, wifi, dsl)
			Add delay / packet loss / etc...
			(System Preference Panel)

		Remote Packet Capture
			Capture wi-fi / cellular data off an iOS device.

			rvictl -s <UDID> create the remote virtual interface
			ifconfig to check the remote virtual interface name (rvi #)
			run tcpdump (or wireshark) tcpdump -n -i rvi0
			rvictl -x rvi0 (remove virtual interface)


## 310 : What's New In Instruments ##

They showed the new features of instruments. Solid talk, cool stuff. Instruments
is great.

Instruments Preferences

		Ability to shutdown cores / simulate slower HW.

Data Focusing

		Ability to focus on a particular function / subtree / function.

Deferred Mode :

		Instruments does not show metrics in "real time". They record metrics in the background and do not

New Instruments : Network Connection

		Watch network traffic / dropped packets / etc.. Nice. Similar to wireshark / filtering.

New Instruments : Network Activity Instruments (Energy Usage)

		Keep the radio off. Burst quick, not slow trickle.

ARC Instrumentation :

		ARC cannot fix retain cycles.
		Leak instrument can detect cycles.

		Just use Leaks in Instruments

Conclusion :

		"Strategies" are new. CPU strategy : better concurrency

Strategy :

		Ability to view performance metrics based off a "strategy"


## 208 : Securing Application Data ##

General overview of security APIs (SecureTransport / *Socket) that Apple
provides in iOS. Some entry level conceptual stuff (TLS / certs).

API

        High level API in foundation:HTTP(S)...socket
        Low level API in SecureTransport: (in iOS 5).

TLS

        SSLHandshake(ctx);

TLS w/o Certificates

        Encrypted, but not secure : man in the middle (he can intercept the key
        exchange).

Certificate Authentication

        Asymmetric keypair (public / private key)

        Use private key to create a signature of data.
        Other party takes public key to verify the sender.

        Prevents the man in the middle.

        Identity : public key + certificate.


Protecting data on the device

        Data Protection allows data to be tied to the user's passcode.

        File Key <- Class Key <- Device Key + User Passcode Key (you have to
        brute force on that particular device).

API's offering data protection

        You need to have a passcode to protect data.

        NSFileManager (NSFileProtectionKey) / CoreData (NSFileProtectionKey) /
        NSData (NSDataWritingOptions) / sqlite3_open_v2 / SecItem
        (kSecAttrAccessible)

        Add "DataProtectionClass" entitle : NSfileProtectionComplete : no data
        can be accessed unless your app is unlocked. Can't access data if
        locked.

Keychain

        Most protected layer in the system. Partitioned between application / etc.
        Use keychain for all important data storage.

        kSecAttrAccessible : tell keychain when the data can be accessed.
        ..WhenUnlocked[ThisDeviceOnly] (highest protection level) ..AfterFirstUnlock[ThisDeviceOnly] (needs
        reboot).

        "ThisDeviceOnly" will not migrate the item to a new device.



## 210 : Mastering Grand Central Dispatch ##

Absolute must for Code42 people. Explains GCD as Apple's NIO offering.

Queues :

        Much more advanced queuing system. Ability to have concurrent queues in
        addition to serial queues.

        Queue based state - pass state to queues.

        Queue priority : low / med / high - and a new "background" priority.

Async I/O:

        High perf async I/O layer for files / network streams.

        Basically our async I/O layer implemented.


## 211 : Bonjour Network Discovery ##

New sample : remote currency - bonjour code sample coming to ADC soon.

Zeroconf's attempt to auto-configure devices. The 90s had a plethora of
protocols (token ring, etc). Today TCP/IP is the only credible networking
protocol.

Bonjour added DHCP and self-assigned link local addresses (169.254.x.x).

Multicast DNS : allows you to use DNS names in your app, each device runs a
multicast DNS responder and responds to all DNS request. Allows you to create an
ad-hoc DNS network.

Bonjour Summary:

        Link-local addressing
        Multicsat DNS (www.multicastdns.org)
        DNS Service Discovery (www.dns-sd.org)

In 10.6 :

        Sleep proxy : transfers a machine's bonjour profile to another machine on the network.
        The proxy will accept request for the destination and wake up the destination.


Bonjour uses standard DNS requests for device lookup / service discovery.

TCP

        Server (listen):
            Create and listen IPv4/IPv6 sockets on the same port.
            Create a CFSocketRef that wraps those two sockets.

        Server (register) :
            [[NSNetService alloc] initWithDomain:@"" type:@"_modring._tcp." name:@"" port:ntohs(sin.sin_port)]; // domain == @"" will search for all domains (local / wide area) if local.

        Server (accept callback) :

            Create a CFSocketRef on the address / port on the address.
            Will get CFSocketRef will send callbacks to your code when

        Client :

        NSInputStream / NSOutputStream -> CFSocket -> socket / bind / listen (darwin) -> kernel
        NSInputStream / NSOutputStream need to be registered into a runloop before they are opened.

        NSNetServiceBrowser : browse for services. NSNetServiceBrowser will give
        you NSInputStream / NSOutputStream.

Bonjour and iOS Multitasking:

        In applicationDidEnterBackground:
            Stop listening and registering..

        In applicationDidActivate:
            Bonjour networking may be broken (registration may be gone, the kernel may have terminated the browsing the UI)

        TN2277 : explains networking / backgrounding relationship.

Bonjour and Peer-to-peer:

        Bonjour over bluetooth (iOS 5 is opt-in (better performance) - requires iOS 5 SDK)

Use asynchronous calls:

        Use NS API and GCD to.

Browse Call : the right way:

        Only browse when you absolutely need it.
        No refresh button.
        No open-ended browsing.

        Resolve and connect only after user selects the device / service. The

## 316 : LLVM Technologies In-Depth ##

Another session with the summary : just use LLVM 3.0.

Type based alias analysis : optimizes code based on types. Enable it in your project using the compiler setting:
		Enforce Strict Aliasing : Yes


Just switch to the new LLVM compiler in Xcode 4.2.

## 322 : Objective-C Advancements In-Depth ##

* Need to re-watch - very good session overall.
