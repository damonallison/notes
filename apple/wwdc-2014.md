# WWDC 2014 #

## Questions ##

* Packages / Namespacing
* Concurrency (GCD still - what about weak / strongSelf)

## 402 - Introduction to Swift ##

Main themes of swift : safety, power, modern


Safe - type inference, braces required in if, no case fallthrough, all cases
required, optionals, default values.

Power -
* range
* property observers (willSet / didSet)
* structs can have methods
* structs have mutating func
* enumerations have .toRaw / .fromRaw
* enums can have associated values
* nested types (enums in a class)
* extensions (to all types - Int, String, etc)
* generic classes/structs.


Modern - tuples (multiple return values), named values in tuple (lightweight data structure)
Functions are simply named closures.

let printer = { println("hello") }
printer()


Trailing closure - if last param is a closure, it can sit outside the parens.
repeat(2) {
}


Class visibility modifiers? Internal? Package?
Overriding properties? Yes - override var...

Structs vs. classes - structs cannot inherit, are value types.


## 403 - Intermediate Swift ##

* Optionals :
	* Work on all types, not only classes as objc.
	* Must be unwrapped to get value. Optional chaining to shortcut on nil.

Memory management - weak refs are optionals.

Packaging? Libraries? Concurrency?

## iOS 8 ##

* Extensions
* Embedded frameworks (use for sharing code between containing app / extension)


#### App Extensions ####

##### App Extension Programming Guide #####
https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214

* Host app - app launching the extension.
* App extension - bundle in the containing app.
* Containing app - Main app containing the extensions.

This is totally Apple. They enable extensions for certain use cases, which they
control. Each extension point has it's own API and must adhere to it's own
security policy.

##### Extension Points #####

* Share
* Action : maniuplate or view content within the context of another app.
* Today : Notification Center widget
* Photo Editing : Photos.app will call these extensions.
* Storage Provider
* Custom Keyboard



* Extensions can have views.
* Extensions can process actions in the background (via a background session).
* Extensions can return results to the host app after the view is destroyed
  (background).
* An extension and containing app can communicate (extension can open containing
  app - does that violate the "host app being in control" mantra?
* An extension can use a NSURLSession background task, but other background
  tasks (VOIP, etc) are not available to background extensions.
* An extension can open it's containing app via openURL:.
